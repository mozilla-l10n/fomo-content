"Thank you for saying that you support net neutrality. We have two more things to ask you to do.\r"
"<br/> <br/>First, if you've never received emails from Mozilla before, look in your email in a few minutes for a message. If you want to receive updates on this campaign and others, you must click the link in your inbox to opt-in for emails.\r"
"<br/> <br/>Second, can you add a donation to Mozilla to help us bring back net neutrality? Most people give around $28 USD, and your contribution will support our work to reclaim the internet from big tech."
