"Established in 2003, guided by the Mozilla Manifesto, the Mozilla Foundation believes the internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible to all. The Mozilla Foundation is "
"a not-for-profit organization that exists to support and collectively lead the open source Mozilla project. It views its work as part of a global movement for a digital environment that aims at "
"putting people in charge of their own data and that makes the internet a more democratic place by mobilizing a critical mass of conscious internet users. Many staff, fellows, and allies of Mozilla "
"generously contributed data and ideas alongside countless readers who participated."
