"In 2022, Mozilla welcomed our inaugural Mozilla Technology Fund cohort, which focused on reducing the bias in and increasing the transparency of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. We "

"id=\"a3\">measuring the unfair outcomes of voice assistant technology</a> to <a id=\"a4\">exposing the inner workings of social media recommendation engines</a>. Building on our learnings from that "
"cohort, we decided to focus our resources in 2023 on an emerging area of tooling where we saw a real opportunity for impact: <a id=\"a5\">open source auditing tools</a>."
