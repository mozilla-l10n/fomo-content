"The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) signals a future where technology not only recognizes but adapts to the diversity and complexity of local realities. This shift is especially critical "
"in marginalized communities, where generic solutions often fail to address specific needs."

"Contextual AI, which takes into account cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic factors, represents a significant advancement in addressing systemic inequalities. By 2025, we will see whether "
"technology is truly ready to surrender to local complexity, transforming its potential into a powerful tool for inclusion and social justice."

"In Brazil, initiatives like the <a id=\"a1\"><b>GERATE Observatory</b></a> (Gender, Race, and Territoriality in Science Observatory) showcase how local analysis and an understanding of community "
"dynamics can influence the responsible use of technology. GERATE maps the circulation of information in favelas and peripheral areas, identifying vulnerable points to disinformation and creating "
"strategies to strengthen these communities' resilience. Much like contextual AI, the observatory's work emphasizes the importance of grasping local particularities to promote informational equity "
"and combat misleading narratives."

"Projects like <b>GriôTech</b>, under development by Mozilla in partnership with the <a id=\"a1\">Peregum Institute</a>, are also at the forefront of this movement, combining technology with "
"ancestral knowledge to combat disinformation. Inspired by African griots, the project integrates technology and, in the future, AI, to amplify historically excluded voices, promoting digital "
"autonomy and anti-racist literacy."

"As regulations like <b>The Brazilian Bill of Law on Artificial Intelligence (Bill No. 2338/2023)</b> begin to shape Brazil's digital ecosystem, the expectation is that technology will become "
"increasingly sensitive to local complexities. This transition reflects the recognition that universal solutions are inadequate for diverse realities. The ability of AI to adapt to specific contexts,"
" coupled with ethical regulation and community-based initiatives, could redefine how technology serves society."
