"Thirty years ago in 1995, Cathy Caruth explained the limitation of language while recapturing traumatic memories in her pioneering anthology, ‘Trauma: Explorations in Memory. Today, there are "
"10,000-20,000 mental health apps, some built on generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT, that directly ‘speak’ to people. We have traveled a long distance – from not being able to find the ‘right "
"language’ to entrusting the role of a therapist/companion to a platform driven by large language models (LLMs). In 2025 and beyond, we may be able to answer the critical question: can machines "
"address trauma?"

"This is a question I have grappled with while building the <a id=\"a1\">Mumkin App pilot</a>, a chatbot which served as a conversation partner for women who have faced gender-based violence. Trauma "
"researcher Gabor Mate underscores trauma as a modern-day epidemic, establishing ‘normalcy’ as a myth. I have firsthand witnessed the veneer of ‘normalcy’ peel away, working with the survivors of "
"gender-based violence for thirteen years as they gradually open up about their trauma."

"These are not easy product development questions. How can women or survivors of other genders feel comfortable opening up their deepest thoughts with a bot? Our answers are not perfect. For one "
"thing, our technology didn’t aim to be for everyone. It spoke to South Asian women in a specific context. Further, as feminist tech creators, we guarded our community’s information to the best "
"possible ability. Our community’s data was theirs alone, and their conversation was strictly private. Further, we didn’t view growth as indicated by increased recurring users or by designing tactics"
" so that people would spend more time on our apps."

"values that made Mumkin what it is are not always present in the AI gold rush to scale users, or drive entertainment and engagement instead of healing."
