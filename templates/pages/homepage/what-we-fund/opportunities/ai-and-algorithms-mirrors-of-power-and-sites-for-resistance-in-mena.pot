"AI and algorithms are neither saviors nor harbingers of doom. Discussions about digital technologies must move beyond binary and simplistic assessments to explore the cultural and socio-political "
"contexts in which these tools operate. What are the intentions of their developers? Where is the power of human agency within technologically mediated spheres? Technologies are not just tools but "
"mirrors, reflecting the complexities of power dynamics in an increasingly digitized world."

"In 2025, the use of AI and algorithms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will become increasingly polarized, serving colonial interests and authoritarian powers by monitoring and "
"suppressing dissent, controlling narratives, and reinforcing political dominance. However, activists will continue to adapt AI and algorithms for resistance, engaging in what is now known as "
"<i>\"Algorithmic Resistance.\"</i> This was vividly demonstrated during the #FreePalestine movement post-October 7, where activists countered Big Tech suppression through innovations such as "
"algospeak, symbolic content, and video alterations."

"This dual-edged use of technology is not new. For years, MENA has been both a testing ground for controlling technologies and a hub for leveraging tech for social change, as seen during the <i>Arab "
"Spring</i> in 2011. This ongoing tug-of-war raises urgent questions: Who holds the power to decide how these tools are used? Is this power static, dominated by geopolitical actors and tech "
"monopolies? Or is it dynamic, shaped by human agency or perhaps an iterative feedback loop between both forces, and even more?"

"These questions point to an inevitable reckoning. AI and algorithms will continue to shape the MENA region, for better and for worse. However, the future lies in how the region shapes these "
"technologies. Our stories, struggles, and dreams must not be reduced to algorithmic data points but instead form the foundation of a more humane and just digital future. Building that future will "
"demand hard conversations, intentional design, and collective action. It will require reimagining AI and algorithms not as inevitable forces but as possibilities—tools we shape with care and "
"intention."

"My work seeks to disrupt several enduring myths: that technologies are neutral or apolitical, that binary classifications capture their effectiveness, and that the relationship between technologies "
"and human agency is static. Technologies—whatever form they take—are not just about code and hardware. They are fundamentally about culture, politics, social justice, and often factors still under "
"exploration."

"My work with Mozilla will reclaim the region’s narratives and ensure that MENA perspectives are centered in global discussions about AI ethics and algorithmic governance. Through 2025-26, the "
"project will produce evidence-based knowledge at the intersection of technology, politics, and conflict. This includes literature reviews, discussion papers, a Casebook, and ongoing conversations "
"with regional and global experts. Our interdisciplinary, intersectional, and collaborative approach fosters critical discussions and advocacy while building a community of experts/scholars to enrich"
" local narratives and challenge the dominance of Global North tech monopolies, Western-centric research and geopolitical powers."
