"Generative AI models are trained on terabytes of web crawl data from across the internet. One of the most popular sources of training data is Common Crawl, a massive archive of web crawl data "

"Google or Meta are using Common Crawl to train their AI products, let alone how they filtered out harmful content.</b>"
