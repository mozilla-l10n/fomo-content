"Our research found that several TikTok influencers in the United States who disseminate political messages on the platform are receiving payment or the promise of compensation from political "
"organizations. In keeping with <a id=\"a1\">FTC guidelines</a>, we define payment as any form of material compensation – financial compensation, complimentary gifts, or trips. Some of this funding "
"could be characterized as “dark money” – political spending that aimed at influencing voters, but where the source of the money and/or the donor is not fully disclosed."

"Furthermore, we found that TikTok doesn’t actively monitor and enforce its rule that influencers disclose paid partnerships, nor does the platform label sponsored posts as advertising. These "
"inconsistent disclosure practices – paired with zero ad transparency tools or archives – makes it very difficult to monitor political influencer ads on TikTok."

"#sponsored were not marked as advertising in the accompanying metadata (“IsAd” = False). The difference is that advertisers must go through TikTok’s ad system in order to run a hashtag challenge or "
"run other kinds of ads, whereas influencer ads are negotiated and transacted off-platform."

"This is meaningful because it tells us that paid partnerships don’t seem to be marked as ads by TikTok, which makes them more difficult for the platform to monitor. Instead, these ads rely on self-"
"disclosure, which, as our research below shows, isn't very effective. Without a strong system in place to monitor influencer ads on the platform, TikTok could be vulnerable to abuse by political "
