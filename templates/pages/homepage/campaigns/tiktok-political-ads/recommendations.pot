"Our research suggests that there is political advertising on TikTok, despite <a id=\"a1\">its policies prohibiting this kind of branded content</a>. In practical terms, this means that political "
"advertising on the platform is going unregulated and unmonitored. And combined with an overall lack of transparency into advertising, there is ample opportunity for political influence to happen "
"under the radar on TikTok. Our findings suggest that the undetected political advertising that we’ve identified on TikTok in the U.S. could easily play out in other countries, and that this is "
"increasingly likely during key political moments like elections or referendums."

"TikTok should create a self-disclosure mechanism that enables creators to disclose partnerships and sponsored content at the time of upload, as Instagram/Facebook and YouTube/Google have done. This "
"could serve a useful first step as TikTok works to monitor and track paid content on its platform in order to enforce its policies more effectively. Our analysis of TikTok’s post metadata suggests "
"that TikTok isn’t currently monitoring branded content in a systematic way; a self-disclosure mechanism could help TikTok develop better processes for tracking branded content systematically."

"TikTok has made the commercial decision to ban political advertisements on its platform. However, that policy will only be effective if it includes all forms of paid political influence on the "
