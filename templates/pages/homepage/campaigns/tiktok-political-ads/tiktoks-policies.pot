"According to TikTok’s <a id=\"a1\">Ad Policy</a>, all political ads are banned on the platform, including ads that promote positions on issues of public importance. The platform does permit cause-"
"based ads from nonprofits or government agencies as long as they are “not driven by partisan political motives.” However, TikTok <a id=\"a2\">doesn't</a> provide a publicly-searchable database of "
"advertising data as <a id=\"a3\">Facebook/Instagram</a>, <a id=\"a4\">Snap</a>, and <a id=\"a5\">Google/YouTube</a> do. Without community oversight into advertising, it’s difficult to verify how "
"TikTok is enforcing its policies in practice."

"TikTok says that content creators must self-identify any paid content (typically with the hashtag #ad or #sponsored), in keeping with <a id=\"a1\">U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines for "
"the disclosure of paid influence</a>. However, influencer ads do not appear to be actively monitored or scrutinized by TikTok, raising concerns around how the platform is enforcing its trust and "

"For instance, two weeks before the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election <a id=\"a1\">a BBC investigation</a> uncovered dozens of anti-Trump get-out-the-vote TikTok posts in which left-wing content "
"creators did not disclose they had been paid by the progressive agency Bigtent Creative, which receives funding from Democratic political organizations and non-partisan organizations. When "
"approached by BBC journalists, TikTok took the posts down, but only after the videos had already amassed hundreds of thousands of views."
