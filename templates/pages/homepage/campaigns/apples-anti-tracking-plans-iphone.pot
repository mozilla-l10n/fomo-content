"In 2019, Mozilla called on Apple to increase user privacy by automatically resetting the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) on iPhones. The IDFA lets advertisers track the actions users take when "
"they use apps – kind of like a salesperson that follows you from store to store while you shop, recording every item you look at. Creepy, right?"

"Early 2020, <a id=\"a1\"><b>Apple went even further than what Mozilla supporters had asked for when it announced</b></a><b> that it will give consumers the option to opt-out of tracking in each app,"
" essentially turning off IDFA and giving millions of consumers more privacy online.</b> Apple’s announcement also made a loud statement: mass data collection and invasive advertising don’t have to "
"be the norm online."

"Unfortunately, as you might imagine, <b>a lot of advertisers, notably</b> <a id=\"a1\"><b>Facebook</b></a><b>, were not happy with Apple</b>. Facebook, which uses IDFA to track users’ activity "
"across different apps and match them to advertising profiles, <a id=\"a2\">says</a> that its advertising partners will be hit hard by this change."

"Apple’s planned implementation of anti-tracking features is a huge win for consumers, many of whom might not even be aware that they can be tracked across apps on their phone. In fact, a 2019 "
"Mozilla-Ipsos poll <a id=\"a1\">revealed</a> that half of iPhone users weren’t even aware that the IDFA and ongoing data collection by apps existed. Further, consumers who <i>did</i> know it existed"
" still did not know how to reset it. Now, with the option to opt-out of tracking at the point-of-use, consumers won’t have to sift through their phone’s settings to protect their privacy. But first,"
" Apple needs to implement the change. We need to make sure the company does not kick the can down the road."
