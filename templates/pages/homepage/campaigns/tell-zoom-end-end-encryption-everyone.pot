"Tools like Zoom can be critical to help protesters organize and communicate their message widely. Activists should be able to plan and conduct protest-related activities without fear that these "

"Best-in-class security should not be something that only the wealthy or businesses can afford. Zoom’s plan not to provide end-to-end encryption to free users will leave exactly those populations "
"that would benefit most from these technologies unprotected. Around the world, end-to-end encryption is already an important tool for journalists and activists that are living under repressive "
"regimes and fighting censorship. We recognize that Zoom's business model includes offering premium features for paid accounts, but end-to-end encryption is simply too important to be one of those "
"premium features."
