"Meta recently launched its own AI app, like ChatGPT. The Meta AI app comes with a “Discover Feed” — a public stream of real user AI conversations posted by users. Meta says that users know that "
"they're sharing their AI conversations publicly. But a number of posts suggest otherwise. You can find posts that appear to show users' personal data, medical issues, work problems, and calendar "
"reminders in the Discover Feed.¹"
