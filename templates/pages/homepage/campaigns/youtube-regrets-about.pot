"#YouTubeRegrets is part of Mozilla’s larger focus to ensure that in a world of AI, consumer technology helps, rather than harms, humanity. We believe that AI should be designed with personal agency "

"We’re not advocating for specific content to be banned or removed. Rather, our campaign is focused on “reach” — drawing attention to the way that AI, in the form of recommendation engines, can "
"amplify certain types of content more than others. We believe there should be greater transparency around YouTube’s methods for determining what gets recommended. It is up to YouTube to determine "
"what kind of content their site encourages and recommends, and they must build social responsibility into their recommendation engine in the same way that they have optimized for user engagement."
