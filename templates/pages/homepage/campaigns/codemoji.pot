"Codemoji was a web-based platform that allowed people to send a short message to friends that was then ciphered into emojis. Once the message was sent, the sender would send the receiver a small "
"hint in order for them to decode the emoji scrambled message. The project was intended to demonstrate in a simple and fun way how encryption works on the web."
