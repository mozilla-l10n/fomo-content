"Intelligence (AI); Mozilla was among the first foundations to focus investment in this area starting in 2019. We’ve funded open source projects working on issues like transparency, bias and "
"environmental justice through <a id=\"a2\">the Mozilla Technology Fund</a>; new models for community-driven data stewardship through <a id=\"a3\">the Data Futures Lab</a>; and artists working to "
