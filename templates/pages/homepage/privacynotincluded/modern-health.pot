"Mozilla recently decided to offer the mental health app Modern Health to employees as part of our wellbeing program. With the growing mental health crisis around the world, many companies are adding"
" access to mental health apps to their wellbeing programs too. It can be challenging to find companies capable of meeting high privacy standards, and so we decided it was important we include a "
"review of the mental health app we offer to share what it is like to navigate these privacy concerns."

"First, a little about Modern Health. The app offers a full spectrum of mental health services, including 1:1 sessions with care professionals, guided meditations, group sessions, digital programs, "
"well-being assessments and more. Offered through your employer, access to the app is free. One of the features Modern Health offers the over 250 companies that use their service is access to "
"\"aggregated and de-identified\" data through a<a id=\"a1\">n</a> <a id=\"a2\">\"Insights Hu</a>b\" . How does Modern Health look from a privacy perspective? We're happy to see they've improved "
"their privacy practices since we first reviewed them in 2022."

"Good news! Modern Health's privacy practices and policies have improved since we released our review in 2022. Indeed, after our review came out, we had many discussions with Modern Health about ways"
" they could improve their privacy policy and clarify their privacy practices. We were heartened to see these implemented. Now, all users of Modern Health, regardless of what privacy laws they live "
"under, have the right to access and delete their data. Modern Health also explicitly states in their privacy policy that they <i>\"do not sell, disclose, and/or share your Personal Information to "
"other businesses or third parties for monetary or valuable consideration.\"</i> That is certainly something we like to see explicitly stated."

"A couple of other improvements we've seen from Modern Health include clarifying in their privacy policy that while they target ads towards employer-customers and brokers based on information "
"gathered from their website, they do not target ads towards Modern Health members or individual consumers. And last year when we reached out to Modern Health at the email listed in their privacy "
"policy for privacy related questions, we never heard back from them. They acknowledged that email was going unmonitored and have since made sure the email addresses listed in their privacy policy "
"for consumers to ask questions are now better monitored."

"We do still have some questions about Modern Health and how they say they can gather personal information about you from third parties and combine that with data they already have on you to provide "

"Modern Health's <a id=\"a1\">privacy notice</a> raised flags for us because they say they can collect a large amount of personal information and combine or enhance this information with more "

"Modern Health did make a clarification in the update they made to their privacy policy on June 30, 2022 regarding how they do interest-based targeted advertising. Their privacy policy reads, \"We do"
" not target any advertisements toward individual consumers or members of our platform. We may engage third party service providers who utilize tracking technologies on our corporate website "
"(www.modernhealth.com) to serve advertisements that may be of interest to potential employer-buyers of our Services. Some of these advertisements may be personalized, meaning that the advertisements"
" are intended to be relevant to potential employer-buyers based on what we, or the third party service providers, know about them...\" So, they do use personal information for targeted advertising, "
"but they say they don't target \"individual consumers or members.\" All this is still a bit confusing. Hopefully this mean if you use Modern Health as a wellness service, nothing you do on the "
"platform or website will be used to target you with ads anywhere else on the internet."
