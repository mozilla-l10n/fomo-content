"Mozilla recently decided to offer the mental health app Modern Health to employees as part of our wellbeing program. With the growing mental health crisis around the world, many companies are adding"
" access to mental health apps to their wellbeing programs too. It can be challenging to find companies capable of meeting high privacy standards, and so we decided it was important we include a "
"review of the mental health app we offer to share what it is like to navigate these privacy concerns."

"First, a little about Modern Health. The app offers a full spectrum of mental health services, including 1:1 sessions with care professionals, guided meditations, group sessions, digital programs, "
"well-being assessments and more. Offered through your employer, access to the app is free. One of the features Modern Health offers the over 250 companies that use their service is access to "
"\"aggregated and de-identified\" data through an \"<a id=\"a1\">Insights Hub</a>\". How does Modern Health look from a privacy perspective? Well, even the mental health app Mozilla uses raises a few"
" privacy concerns for us. We hope to see improvements. We will update this post when we do."

"Update: Modern Health updated their privacy policy again on September 28, 2022. We've include a note on these updates below. After working with Modern Health for months to improve their privacy "

"Modern Health's <a id=\"a1\">privacy notice</a> raised flags for us because they say they can collect a large amount of personal information and combine or enhance this information with more "
"information they collect on you from third parties for things such as providing more personalized services. Modern Health says they can collect a fair amount of personal information, including name,"

"Modern Health did make a clarification in the update they made to their privacy policy on June 30, 2022 regarding how they do interest-based targeted advertising. Their privacy policy reads, “We do "
"not target any advertisements toward individual consumers or members of our platform. We may engage third party service providers who utilize tracking technologies on our corporate website "
"(www.modernhealth.com) to serve advertisements that may be of interest to potential employer-buyers of our Services. Some of these advertisements may be personalized, meaning that the advertisements"
" are intended to be relevant to potential employer-buyers based on what we, or the third party service providers, know about them…” So, they do use personal information for targeted advertising, but"
" they say they don't target “individual consumers or members.” All this is still a bit confusing. Hopefully this mean if you use Modern Health as a wellness service, nothing you do on the platform "
"or website will be used to target you with ads anywhere else on the internet."
