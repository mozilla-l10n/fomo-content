"Michael Bublé, Kris Jenner, amd others <a id=\"a1\">invested</a> $40 million in this app in 2021, in part to help in <i>\"</i><a id=\"a2\"><i>reimagining</i></a><i> how we connect with God through "
"technology.\"</i> The Glorify app offers daily devotionals, prayers, reflections, biblical meditations, and prayer lists for around $50 for an annual subscription (costs vary according to <a "
"id=\"a3\">their price list</a> on the Apple app store). It's good to remember, the money invested in Glorify by high profile investors is generally because they are hoping to make a profit. As "

"In a 2021<a id=\"a1\"> interview with TechCrunch</a>, Glorify's 22-year old co-founder Ed Beccle said of his Christian-targeted wellness app, \"<i>We don’t monetize through ads; the user really "
"isn’t the product.\"</i> Which sounds great. However, we're not so sure it's true based on what we found in Glorify's privacy policy."

"Glorify's privacy policy clearly states the personal information you provide them is considered a business asset. It also clearly states that while they don't sell your personal information, they "
"can use it for a good deal of targeted advertising and sharing with third-parties for tailored marketing purposes. And Glorify says they can combine your personal information with information they "
"get from third-party sources such as gender and birth date and they can use that information to provide you with information about their business, products, and services. Which means they can use "
"all that personal information to try and sell you more stuff."

"In that same TechCrunch interview, Glorfy's co-founder stated, <i>\"I believe the engaged audience that we will have will probably have a higher propensity to pay for all sorts of other products "
"that we release. ... [we think we can] take that audience and direct them to other products that we've created, where they’ll have high propensity to pay.\"</i> It's a good reminder that prayer apps"
" come at a cost, as with so much on the internet in our existing data economy, This, coupled with the fact we couldn't confirm if Glorify meets our Minimum Security Standards, and we must say if you"
" are concerned about privacy, buyer beware."
