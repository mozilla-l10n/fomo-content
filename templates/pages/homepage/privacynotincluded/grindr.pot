"Launched in 2009, Grindr says it's the largest social networking app for gay, bisexual, trans, and queer people. Though their marketing focuses mostly on men -- at least that's what we gathered when"
" we visited their website and found it full of guys in their undies -- all genders can join. The app matches people based on location using the location tracking features on your phone. Grindr is "
"free to sign up. Paying users can eliminate those third-party ads, unlock extra match filters, get read receipts, and even go incognito. Historically, Gindr has had a pretty awful track record on "
"privacy, including coming under fire for its data breaches and sharing user data to advertisers without user consent. But how does their privacy hold up in 2024? Yup, we have to say they're still "
"pretty awful. Spoiler alert: we warn that *Privacy Not Included comes with Grindr."

"Holy privacy documents, Grindr! We haven't seen so many since we reviewed Toyota. And in case you're thinking \"Hotdog! That must be a good sign for Grindr's privacy and security,\" we're sorry to "
"say, it is not. It's privacy and security dings across the board for this app targeted at gay men. Grindr says they can share and even <b>sell</b> your personal information. They don't guarantee all"
" users the same right to delete all the personal information they collect on you. They claim they require a strong password but we found we could log into the app with '11111111 as a password on "
"Android phones). They are very icky about pushing users to agree to lots of data collection, sharing, and selling at sign-up. And Grindr has a pretty terrible track record at protecting and "

"Grindr's <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> says that aside from your email or phone number and your birthday, no other information is required to use Grindr. Then it goes ot to say that not providing "

"Profile that you want to keep private</i>\". Great advice! That seems really important for Grindr users to know since you're invited to share a lot of sensitive personal information in your Grindr "
"profile. Things like your HIV status, weight, ethnicity, vaccination status, photos, videos, and your location, of course. Your location is a tricky one because that's what helps you find people "

"private is to turn off location services on your device or browser. But doing that means you won't be able to see nearby users. So, you don't technically have to share a lot of information with "

"Now, the question is how -- or if -- they get users' consent to do this. It's one thing if they very explicitly ask for it, don't force users to opt-out, rather clearly ask them to opt-in, and allow"

"says, <i>\"Grindr is currently revising its terms of service to ask people explicitly if the company can train its AI models on their personal data, which could include direct messages,\"</i> well, "
"that revision doesn't exist yet, so we can't evaluate it. And we're guessing most Grindr users don't read those Terms of Service or privacy policies, so they might miss a notice or get opted-in if "
"they don't pay close attention. Indeed, when we dug through Grindr's vast privacy documentation, we found this paragraph that might be hinting at their move to use users' DMs for business purposes "
"like training their AI's, \"<i>Grindr is transitioning to the storage of chat messages on its servers to support the use of the Grindr Services including enhanced safety features and an improved "
"user experience across multiple platforms and devices, which will result in a longer retention in compliance with our data retention policy.\"</i> So, it seems your Grindr DMs aren't just stored "
"locally, they are stored on Grindr's servers where you just have to trust them to secure them, protect and respect them, and not use them to train their AI models or \"understand you better\" "
