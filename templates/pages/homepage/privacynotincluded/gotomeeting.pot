"GoToMeeting has been around since 2004, making it one of the old-school video call apps available. Primarily targeted as a business video call platform, GoToMeeting has pricing plans that allow for "
"up to 3000 people in a video meeting. It can also be made HIPAA compliant to meet US healthcare privacy laws. It's probably not going to be the video call app you use for your family gatherings or "
"virtual happy hours, which means most of the people using this app will be able to rely on their company's tech team for support and privacy. Which is good because while it's not NOT user-friendly "
"(although its privacy policy is certainly not user-friendly), it is a more advanced video call app than most people probably need for calls home to Mom. And they did improve their user interface "
"over the last year in an effort to keep up with Zoom and Microsoft Teams."

"Probably (hopefully) not too much will go wrong given this is a video call app targeted to business rather than folks calling family. It is likely many of the companies using this software will have"
" admins to help run it. We like that it uses end-to-end encryption, has the option to password protect meetings and – with some extra work – make calls HIPAA compliant. That being said, video calls "
"can be transcribed by a \"smart AI meeting assistant\" at the request of the host, so it's always good to follow the general rule of thumb and be careful what you say as you never know who could be "
"listening (or reading). The company does share data with third-parties for marketing purposes, as do many of the apps we review. A few other tips if you want to be extra safe: Password protect your "
"meetings, lock your meeting once you're in a session, and set an expiration date on your recording."
