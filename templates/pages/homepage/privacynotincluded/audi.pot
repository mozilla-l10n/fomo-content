"German auto manufacturer Audi is known for their luxury cars, their 4-ringed logo, and their slogan \"<i>Vorsprung durch Technik</i>\" (<i>Progress through Technology</i>). A subsidiary of the "
"Volkswagen Group, Audi makes electric cars, sedans, coupes, wagons, SUVs, and sporty convertibles. Following along with BMW, they won't win any awards for creativity in naming their cars with models"

"Uhg, Audi, really?!? Why must you make things so hard for people (especially in the US) who want to buy your cars -- and for privacy researchers! -- to understand your privacy policies? Let's just "

"policy or use something called Key User or sign up for the Connect PRIME services. Confused yet? We were. Then there is the <a id=\"a4\">privacy page for the Volkswagen Group of America</a> (which "
"owns Audi) where consumers can submit a privacy request in the United States, but <i>ONLY</i> if you live in certain states like California with stronger privacy laws. Speaking of California, USA, "

"personal information, car data, and other data on you. Everything from our name, email, phone number, where you live, age, gender, your geolocation data based on your car and phone's GPS, those "
"voice commands you make in the car, and lots and lots of vehicle usage data like vehicle speed, seat belt usage, what the temperature is, and so much more. Oh, yeah, there's also all the data they "

"So Audi knows a ton about you, your car, your driving habits, the locations you visit, how often you lose your parked car, what streaming music you listen to, how fast you drive, and then they make "

"Audi does a good job protecting all that personal information, vehicle data, connected service and myAudi app usage information right? Nope. Unfortunately, Audi (and their parent company VW Group) "
"have bit of a spotty track record at respecting and protecting all that personal information they collect. Back in 2021 they announced a <a id=\"a1\">big old data breach</a> that saw the <a "
"id=\"a2\">personal information of 3.3 million users</a> compromised and then <a id=\"a3\">offered up for sale by hackers</a> resulting in a <a id=\"a4\">$3.5 million class action settlement</a>. "
"Shoot. Audi's own privacy policy warns users that while they maintain <i>\"reasonable safeguards to protect your information. Some services, including Audi connect services, may involve the "
"transmission of voice and data from your Audi vehicle over wireless and cellular telephone networks and therefore, we cannot guarantee the privacy and security of conversations or data transmitted "
"to and from your Audi vehicle.\"</i> So yeah, that's a good reminder that there are no guarantees that your personal information, including things as personal and private as your voice data, will be"
