"Mi—owned by Beijing-based Xiaomi—offers the Mi Band 6 as a lower cost health and fitness tracker. It tracks what most fitness trackers track--heart rate, sleep, stress, steps, calories, menstrual "
"cycles, and more. Should you trust it? Xiaomi, the parent company of Mi, was recently caught secretly collecting data on some users, so buyer beware."

"Things got a little confusing for us while reviewing the Mi Band 6. The company that sells the Mi Band is Chinese tech giant Xiaomi. It seems the company that may make the device technology is "
"Huami, which also makes the Amazfit fitness trackers. The privacy policy on the Mi website links to a Xiaomi privacy policy. When we spoke with representatives from Mi, they told us their Mi Band 6 "
"had a <a id=\"a1\">device-specific privacy policy</a> and shared a pdf with us of a privacy policy from Huami, one we couldn’t find anywhere publicly online. The company says users can only access "
"the privacy policy once they've downloaded the app. Oh, and recently Huami changed its name to Zepp Health Corp. As we said, it’s all very confusing."

"What we do know is, Xiaomi--the company behind the Mi Band-- came under fire in 2020 when <a id=\"a1\">researchers reportedly found</a> they were secretly collecting users' data during private web "
"browsing and phone use. According to the Xiaomi privacy policy, the company does not sell personal information to third parties. They say they may share personal information with Xiaomi affiliates "
"and the Mi Ecosystem. They also share personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. According to the Huami privacy policy the representatives from Mi shared with us, they can also "
"share personal information with Huami-affiliated companies and with third parties for advertising and other purposes."

"All in all, it seems to us a lot of personal information may be shared with any number of affiliate companies in the Xiaomi, Mi, Huami ecosystem. And we found it very odd they provided us with a pdf"
" of a privacy policy for the device that we were unable to find publicly available online. Consumers should be able to read a product's privacy policy before buying the product or downloading the "
"app. What’s the worst that could happen? Well, this device collects a lot of personal information and we can’t exactly tell where all that personal information is going in the confusing world of "
"privacy policies we reviewed. That’s not good for consumers at all."
