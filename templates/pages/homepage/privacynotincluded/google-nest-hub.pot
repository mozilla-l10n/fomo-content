"If you like the idea of a smart video hub that lets you display your photos, watch YouTube, listen to podcasts, and control you lights with your voice, but you don't want a video camera watching you"
" all the time, this is the gadget for you. Unlike Google's more expensive Nest Hub Max, the Nest Hub has no built-in camera to watch you. So it's perfect for your bedside table. Which is where "
"Google hopes you'll put it so it can do some sleep sensing, a feature Google added that uses motion and sound to monitor your sleep. Wake up every morning and it'll tell you if you slept, when you "
"slept, and how your slept. And it's got three built-in microphones, so maybe switch those and the sleep sensing off when your friend with benefits comes for a visit. Google doesn't need to track "
"every aspect of your life!"

"Google seems to do a better job than some of the other Big Tech companies when it comes to privacy (looking at you Facebook). That said, you should be aware they are a huge ad company that needs "
"your data to sell ads. Google promises that your voice recordings won’t be used to send you personalized ads, but they admit transcripts of your voice interactions with your Google Nest Hub may. "
"Google uses your personal information to show you ads all over the place like in your Gmail, in your favorite Solitaire app, on partner websites, and on YouTube. Yup, the ads are everywhere."

"We do like that users are now automatically opted out of Google's human review of voice recordings, because that was super creepy. We also like that Google does try to communicate with users how "
"they collect and use data, like the sleep sensing data this device collects, in their <a id=\"a1\">Safety Center</a>. They claim that sleeps sensing data is not used for ad personalization, which is"
" good. Google does collect a lot of other data on you though, especially if you don't take the time to <a id=\"a2\">adjust your privacy settings</a> to lock down just how much info they can gather. "
"You should absolutely take the time to adjust these privacy settings. Just beware, you will get notifications that some things might not work right if you change settings. That’s annoying, and "
"probably worth it for a little more privacy. If you don't take the time, it's possible Google can get to know you really well, maybe too well. Maybe they recognize you from all the times you ordered"
