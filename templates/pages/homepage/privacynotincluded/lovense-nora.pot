"In a world where a pandemic means long distance relationships are common, long distance toys for intimacy are keeping up. The Nora vibrator, which partners with the Lovense Max 2 male masturbator, "
"connects to the Lovense Remote app via Bluetooth. Once connected, couples can sync with each other's toys, for a two-way interactive experience. When the Nora moves, the Max responds. When the Max "
"moves, the Nora responds. The speed of your movements is felt on the other end by your partner, and vise versa. And to be inclusive of all couples, two Noras can sync together, two Maxes can sync "
"together, as well a Nora and a Max syncing together. Couples can also control each other's toys with a smartphone or tablet. You can even record an interactive two-way session and play it back for "
"those times when your partner isn't able to join in."

"Lovense seems to do a pretty good job protecting users privacy and security. We love that they don't sell any user data they collect. They do collect and use personal information for things like "
"third party analytics service providers and advertising partners if users chose to share that data, which is a fairly common practice so it doesn't worry us too much. Their privacy policy and "
"privacy FAQ are written in fairly easy to understand language so users can know what types of data they collect, how they use it, and how long they keep it which is great. And everything you do over"
" the app is encrypted, so you're sexy time chats and pictures can't easily be seen by random people. The Nora is a vibrator that connects to an app over Bluetooth and that app can be controlled over"
" the internet, so it's not completely risk free. There's always a chance someone--a jilted lover, a kid who learns their parent's password--could gain access to the app and see some pretty personal "
"information or worse, jack your vibrator up to its highest setting and give you a jolt you weren't expecting."
