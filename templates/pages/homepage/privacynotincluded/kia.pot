"Kia is a South Korean car company founded in 1944 as a maker of bike parts. Today Kia -- owned in part by the other major South Korean car maker, Hyundai -- is <a id=\"a1\">known</a> as one of the "
"most reliable car brands in the world. Models include the Sportage, Soul, Sorento, Forte, Rio, and EVs the Niro and EV6. Their Kia Access app and Kia Connect connected services all owners to do "
"remote things like lock/unlock the car, find your car, set your car's cabin temperature, send locations to your cars navigation system, check your EVs charing status, find charging stations, and "
"even pair the app with your smartwatch. So, how is happy little Kia at privacy? Holy cow, they are terrible! That makes us anything but happy."

"Kia’s approach to privacy is all over the map. But mostly, it’s bad. Let’s cut to the chase: Kia says they can collect a lot of sensitive and personal information they have no business collecting. "
"The list is long and includes some of the creepiest data categories we have ever seen (since reviewing Nissan, at least) like your “<b>genetic information</b>” and “<b>sex life</b>.” Could there be "
"a “good” reason for your car maker to have that information? Probably not. If there is, we definitely didn’t find it in Kia’s privacy policy. We did learn that they may use your personal information"
" to “deliver advertising or marketing communications based on your interests.” Boooo."

"Kia can also collect, according to their <a id=\"a1\">US Privacy Policy</a>, information about your “medical condition, physical or <b>mental disability</b>,” “racial or <b>ethnic origin</b>,” and "
"“religious or <b>philosophical beliefs</b>.” They even say they can collect “the contents of certain mail, emails, and <b>text messages</b>.” Huh? We can only assume that means your communications "
"with Kia, but that’s such a weird and vague way to put that. We have so many questions. Like, how? But also, why?"
msgstr ""

"Now, Kia does say that they don’t collect sensory data (like audio and visual data). Phew! That is a relief since it’s pretty common for car makers to collect the data created by vehicle features "
"that use microphones and cameras. They also say that they do not collect biometric data (like your face and fingerprints). That’s another load off, since sharing that information comes with certain "
"<a id=\"a1\">risks</a>. But wait, “unique biometric information” is listed as an example of “Sensitive Personal Information” that they do collect. Hmm. It seems like some of Kia’s data-collecting "
"disclosures were written to cast as wide a data-catching net as possible. That is a technique we privacy researchers really hate to see when we read privacy policies. Their policy even mentions "
"“Personal information described in California Civil Code Section 1798.80(e)” which we learned from reviewing Honda and others car companies, <a id=\"a2\">means</a> just about any personal "
"information under the sun “capable of being associated with you.” Yikes!"

"In their Kia Connected Services <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>, Kia says they can collect many of the same categories of personal information listed in their <a id=\"a2\">US Privacy Policy</a>, "
"including the creepy ones we mentioned earlier. That’s especially uncool since connected services can open up a <b>third-party</b> can o’ worms. Here’s what we mean: Even though the connected "
"services you get through your Kia are provided by Kia, they sometimes rely on third-party providers who may need “access to user information to carry out the services they are performing for you or "
"for [them].” Which services and which service providers? We can’t be sure of all of them because Kia only lists the categories of companies with a few examples."

"Another thing about Kia’s connected services: some of them are a bit creepy. Kia’s “My Car Zone” lets you set alerts that log other drivers’ behavior in your car. Called “Curfew Alerts, Geo-Fence, "
"&amp; Speed Watch,” car-owners can create settings that collect information about other drivers’ habits, “such as <b>when the Vehicle is being driven</b> and whether the Vehicle is being driven "
"beyond a pre-determined <b>speed limit</b> or <b>boundary location</b>.” This feature is pitched with a parent-child relationship in mind but it’s ripe for abuse by controlling partners or family "

"And it’s not just your car’s connected services that can give away access to your data. Kia has apparently no control over how the <b>third-party apps</b> available through your car’s dashboard "

" in their quest to “Learn more about [their] customers and their [customers’] experiences” (that’s another thing that Kia says they can do with your information). They also <b>collect information "

"Kia also uses this mountain of data to create more data about you, called “<b>inferences</b>.” Practically all the car makers we looked at do. Poor form, everyone! Those inferences or assumed facts "

"One other thing that Kia does seem to do with your data is sell it. Yuck! We really hate that because they collect so much data and then say they can sell it to make more money. Nearly all the car "

" “partners,” “service providers,” “advertising and social networks,” as well as “data analytics, data enhancement, and market research providers.” Kia might also comply with “<b>governmental "
"requests</b>” for your data. Ugh, that word! At Mozilla, we <a id=\"a1\">believe</a> your personal information should only be shared with the government and law enforcement when there is a legal "
"obligation to do it. And, even then, as minimally as possible. Kia, please help yourself to our verbiage and do better. Governments shouldn't simply be able to \"request\" people's precise location "
