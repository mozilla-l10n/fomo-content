"Sonos' smart speakers (and sounds bars) -- which include the Era 300 &amp; 100, One, Roam, Move 2, Five, Beam, Arc, and Ray -- take the sound quality of Sonos speakers and adds in voice control, via"
" their own <a id=\"a1\">Sonos Voice Control</a>. You can still use Alexa or Google Assistant through your Sonos smart speaker too, but you don’t have to if you're not a fan of Google or Amazon. "

"Say it ain’t Sonos! In recent years, some Sonos speakers have been on our Best Of list – a category that we really wish was less exclusive. But this year, we are sad to say, Sonos has landed on our "

"Sonos' <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> says that they don’t sell your personal information to third parties. But their <a id=\"a2\">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) disclosure</a> says "
"otherwise. According to the law in California, a sale doesn’t just mean exchanging data for money, but includes other kinds of business exchanges for monetary value as well. By that definition, "
"Sonos can “sell” your IP address, zip code, time and date of visit, browser type and version, operating system, device make and model. contact information, such as hashed email address, Sonos device"
" type, genre of the station you are currently listening to, listener ID, language, to advertising partners, advertisers, unaffiliated third parties for their advertising purposes, and analytics "

"And if you decide to use Sonos Radio, a $7.99 subscription service that plays you curated music and lets you tune into over 60,000 radio stations around the world, Sonos can use information about "

"We do still love that Sonos went and <a id=\"a1\">built their own AI voice assistant</a> for their Sonos smart speakers that processes all your voice requests <a id=\"a2\">right on the device</a>. "
"So, when you ask Sonos to play Taylor Swift’s new album over and over using their Sonos voice assistant, no one hears that but you. Sonos does not retain a copy or transcript of your voice "
"recording. This is <a id=\"a3\">way better than</a> using Amazon’s Alexa or the Google Assistant AI’s that collect and process and retain lots of information about you -- even if Sonos doesn't. So, "
"when you get your new Sonos smart speaker, you will have to actively enable a voice assistant and we recommend using the <a id=\"a4\">Sonos Voice Control</a> over Alexa or Google Assistant if you "

"Good work Sonos! Sonos also patched those flaws quickly. Vulnerabilities aren't good, but being proactive about cybersecurity? That's something we really love to see. While we're banging that drum, "
