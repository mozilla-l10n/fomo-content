"What's this? Headphones that brag about how well they play music and cancel sound? It's refreshing to see. Sony seems to focus on all things audio with these pricey, critically acclaimed wireless "
"headphones. They do offer something called \"smart listening technology\" so when you start to talk, the headphones pause the music so you can have a \"hands-free conversation\" (who knew we needed "
"hands-free conversations!). For the most part, Sony keeps it all about what you hear — or don't hear — when you put these things on. Hey, that actually sounds good."
