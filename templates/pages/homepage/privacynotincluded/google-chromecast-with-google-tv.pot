"\"Hey Google!\" That will become your new favorite saying if you go the route of Chromecast with Google TV. This little dongle lets you stream what you're watching or listening to on your phone or "
"tablet to your TV. And Google TV puts all the content from all your streaming services on the screen in one place. Just say, \"Hey Google, show me rom coms,\" and all the rom coms from Netflix, "
"Hulu, Amazon Prime, and more will appear on screen. Nifty."

"Google seems to do a better job than some of the other Big Tech companies when it comes to privacy (looking at you Facebook). That said, you should be aware they are a huge ad company that needs "
"your data to sell ads. Google promises that your voice recordings won’t be used to send you personalized ads, but they admit transcripts of your voice interactions with your Google Assistant to "
"control your Chromecast with Google TV may. So, when you say, “Hey Google, show me the football game,’ Google might assume you’re a sports fan and recommend you lots of other sports to watch, while "
"also trying to sell you a jersey for the team you watch most. Google uses your personal information to show you ads all over the place like in your Gmail, in your favorite Solitaire app, on partner "

"might not work right if you change settings. That’s annoying, and probably worth it for a little more privacy. If you don't take the time, it's possible Google can get to know you really well, maybe"
" too well. Google knows that you like to watch sappy rom coms at certain times each month and starts treating you with ads for chocolate and wine and you fall into a rut of watching movies and "
"eating chocolate and drinking wine and, you know what, that doesn't sound so bad. Maybe it's OK Google knows you so well. Maybe it's creepy?"
