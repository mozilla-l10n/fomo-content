"Before video call features came standard on mobile phones (shoot, almost before mobile phones), there was Skype. Launched in 2003, the former king of video calls has added features in an effort to "
"keep up with the booming video call competition — recently they even partnered with the new Space Jam movie so you could have Lebron James in your background. Skype lets users blur their background "

"Skype has had some privacy concerns in the past, most notably when it came to light that Microsoft, which owns Skype, allowed contract workers in China to listen in to Skype calls with \"no security"
" measures\" in place. It has since changed this practice, but it is a good reminder that even companies with decent security practices can handle your private data and conversations sloppily. "
"Because Skype has been popular for a number of years, it has become a target for malware and phishing attacks. Users are able to set up two-factor authentication on Skype, which we recommend to help"
