"If your dating tastes lean more towards people 30 - 55 who have a certain level of education, career, work ethic, and earning power, Elite Singles could be the matchmaking site for you. It sounds at"
" tad snooty, and that's exactly what some people are looking for. With over 13 million users worldwide, Elite Singles claims 90% of users are over 30 and 85% of users have a university education.  "
"Users don't search the pool of people and pick who they want on Elite Singles like on many other dating apps. Instead the app matches you to people based on a long personality questionnaire that "
"analyzes 29 personality traits (who knew we all had so many personality traits!) and then shoots those matches your way. Elite Singles probably isn't for everyone, but hey, what dating app is?"

"Dating apps collect a LOT of personal information on their users. When you connect a social media account like Facebook to that dating app, both Facebook and the dating app now potentially collect "
"more information together. That's why we recommend users don't link your dating app to Facebook. While Elite Singles says they don't \"sell\" your personal information based on a the legal "
"definition of \"sell\", they aren't clear on how they might otherwise share or exchange your information. Data collection is pretty common, but you give out a lot more personal information on dating"
" apps like Elite Singles beyond name and location. You also could share your income level, ethnicity, religion, and even your height. Elite Singles hasn't had any data breaches in the past couple of"
" years (yay!), another app owned by Spark Networks (Zoosk) did have a recent data breach (boo!). Which is a good reminder that data shared and stored by a company is never 100% safe. Finally, Elite "
"Singles does use an artificial intelligence driven algorithm to help match you with potential dates. We weren't able to determine if they take any steps to avoid bias in that algorithm, but they do "
"ask users to share their ethnicity and religion, which means bias on those traits could factor into how their algorithm matches you to others. What's the worst that could happen? Elite Singles "
"collects a ton of information on you, Facebook could get access to that information and target you with all sorts of ads for crazy things like conspiracy theories about the Earth being flat and you "
"end up losing touch with reality. Hey, it could happen! (PS. The Earth is round.)"
