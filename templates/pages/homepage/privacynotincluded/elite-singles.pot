"If your dating tastes lean more towards people 30 - 55 who have a certain level of education and earning power, Elite Singles could be the matchmaking site for you. It sounds a tad snooty, and "
"that's exactly what some people are looking for. Elite Singles claims to have earned the trust of more than 13 million singles worldwide and creates around 2000 new couples every month. They also "
"say their members are the ambitious type and that 85% have an above-average education. Users don't search the pool of people and pick who they want on Elite Singles like on many other dating apps. "
"Instead the app matches you to people based on a long personality questionnaire that analyzes 29 personality traits (who knew we all had so many personality traits!) and then shoots those matches "
"your way. Elite Singles probably isn't for everyone, but hey, what dating app is?"

"If you think privacy and security are part of the elite experience offered by Elite Singles, you are about to be dissapointed. We are sorry to say that this app -- and its Spark-Network-owned "
"sisters, like Zoosk, ChristianMingle, and Jdate -- all earn our *Privacy Not Included warning label. That's kinda the opposite of elite."

"Elite Singles sure can collect a lot of personal information about its users. First there's contact information, like your name, email, address, and phone number. Then there's what counts as "
"\"sensitive information\" like -- excuse me? -- your \"sexual preferences and experiences\". It's not unheard of for sex-related data to make its way into privacy policies but \"experiences\"? That "
"is a new one for us. There's also your race, ethnicity, political affiliation, religious affiliation, union memberships, biometric information, videos, \"physical characteristics\" and a lot more. "
"Basically, all the information you give about yourself while you're on the app can be collected by Elite Singles, including whatever you add to your profile or send in messages. And when Elite "
"Singles collects your photos and videos, they can collect extra information from the files (called metadata) -- like the time the photo was taken, where, and what day. They can also scan your "
"content with third party services to \"help identify your interests and activities—such as if your photo includes pets, sports or trips—and to help [them] provide better matches for you.\" So you "
"might want to crop out any objects in the background you don't want used for matching -- like your beater car."

"On top of all that, there's some information collected automatically from your device. Mostly that's information about your device, but can include personal information like your IP address and even"
" other apps that you've downloaded. Oh, and location data. Did we mention everything you do on Elite Singles? That's data too. Good grief, there is more. Elite Singles can collect information about "
"you from other sources -- like other people, social media, affiliates, and \"third-party information providers\". And they can use your personal information to make assumptions about you, called "
"inferences. You should also know that Elite Singles' privacy policy also says users can import their address book and can be notified when their contacts sign up for the services. That might be "
"awkward if your ex still has your contact in their phone."

"Oh my, that's a lot! The privacy policy even says that \"[w]here you do not provide the personal data detailed in this Policy, we may not be able to provide you with the Services.\" OK so at least "
"some of the time, giving up all that information isn't exactly \"optional\" either. What is it all for? Aside from finding you a first-class partner, Elite singles can use personal information such "
"as your gender, age, and \"usage data\" to \"deliver relevant website content and advertisements to you\" and to measure their effectiveness. That's not good. They can also share your personal "
"information with their affiliates -- which includes all those other apps owned by Spark Network. They can also share your personal information with \"[a]advertising networks and technology "
"companies\" unless you opt out."

"Finally, even though Elite Singles' security scored slightly better than other Spark-Network-owned apps, we still couldn't confirm whether the app meets our Minimum Security Standards. Boooo. A "
