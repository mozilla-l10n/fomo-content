"Amazon Ring's indoor and outdoor security cameras have all the usual--HD video, night vision, motion activation--to put your house under 24-hour surveillance. Monitor the video through the Ring app "

"Amazon’s Ring security cameras and video doorbells are the <a id=\"a1\">most widely used</a> home video cameras in many parts of the world today. As one expert from US privacy org the Electronic "
"Frontier Foundation <a id=\"a2\">put it,</a> \"Ring has steadily been becoming one of the largest surveillance apparatuses in the nation.” And as wise comic book prophet Stan Lee reminds us, “With "

"Ring has a history of not protecting users' privacy. At one point <a id=\"a1\">they reportedly stored customer data</a>--including video recordings--unencrypted on an Amazon cloud server and "

" good amount of personal information that Amazon Ring doesn’t disclose. They have gotten more transparent in their privacy and data deletion practices, which we appreciate. And they added <a "
"id=\"a4\">two-factor authentication</a> to help protect users in 2020, which was a great step forward. One we here at Mozilla <a id=\"a5\">pushed hard</a> for."

"Ring says they do not sell data. However, it shares it with numerous third parties, for purposes that include marketing. In January 2020, <a id=\"a1\">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) found</a> "
"out the Ring app is sharing data with many others trackers not mentioned in the policy. Also, EFF discovered that the data shared with the trackers included full names, email addresses, device "
"information such as OS version and model, whether Bluetooth is enabled, and app settings such as the number of locations a user has Ring devices installed in. Even small amounts of information allow"
" tracking companies to form a “fingerprint” that follows the user as they interact with other apps and use their device, allowing trackers to spy on a user’s digital life."
