"It seems most dating apps targeted at members of the LGBTQ+ community often target the individual groups within the community rather than the community as a whole. Qutie wants to target the entire, "
"diverse community. That makes it unique. Launched in 2016, Qutie bills itself as a dating app and social networking site for the full spectrum of the LGBTQ community.  It doesn't seem to have a a "
"huge user base yet, which is perhaps an interesting commentary on how the LGBTQ community feels about broad dating apps as opposed to niche ones. With a cute app interface, Qutie provides users a "
"couple of questionnaires to help them find matches."

"While Qutie is small and cute, there were a few things that creeped us out about it. The main one being how they collect and use your Facebook data if you chose to sign in using your Facebook login."
" Their privacy policy says if you sign in using Facebook, \"you authorise us to access certain Facebook account information, such as your public Facebook profile, your email address, interests, "
"likes, sexual orientation, gender, birthday, education history, relationship interests, current city, photos, personal description, friend list, and information about and photos of your Facebook "
"friends who might be common Facebook friends with other Qutie users.\" Yikes! That's a lot of information their getting from Facebook. And when you connect a social media account like Facebook to "
"that dating app, both Facebook and the dating app now potentially collect more information together. That's why we recommend users don't link your dating app to Facebook. On top of that, Qutie does "
"appear to allow users to delete their data upon request. We also found we were able to login to the app with the weak password 123456. All in all, we applaud Qutie for trying to be a place for "
"everyone in the LGBTQ+ community. We just wish they'd make more of an effort to protect the personal information of those users because potentially getting outed before you are ready by your dating "
"app would be no fun at all."
