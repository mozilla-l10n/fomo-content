"Acura, the luxury car brand made by Japanese-based car maker Honda, started back in 1986. Car models include the sedans Integra and TLX, and their SUVs the RDX and MDX. Their <a id=\"a1\">AcuraLink "
"app</a> and Acura's connected services lets you do the remote things like lock and unlock the car, start the car, and find your car when you've misplaced it and even send commands to your car with "
"Amazon Alexa. Many of Acura's connected car features require a subscription, as this is the way of the world these days. So, how is Acura at privacy? Well, their share their parent company Honda's "

"id=\"a4\">vehicle data privacy practice statements</a>, at least for people in the US, all of them parent compay Honda's privacy policies). You start off by saying you totally take privacy seriously"
" and you're all on board with <a id=\"a5\">this set of privacy principles</a> an automotive industry group created back in 2014. Those principles include things like transparency, data minimization,"

"can collect, share, maybe even sell, and more. So much for privacy principles. (We should note, nearly every car company we reviewed also signed on to these privacy principles and as far as we can "

"Let us give you an example of what we mean when we say Honda/Acura doesn't seem to treat these privacy principles seriously. One of those stated principles is \"data minimization.\" To Honda/Acura "
"that means, <i>\"Honda commits to collecting Covered Information only as needed for legitimate business purposes.\"</i> Except, they seem to have a very broad definition of \"legitimate business "
"purposes.\" Here's a fun line we found in their privacy documentation: <i>\"Covered Information disclosed with Third Parties may include all or some of the following: Personal Identifiers; Audio "
"electronic, visual, or similar information; Commercial Information; Geolocation Information;</i> <b><i>Personal information as described in Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e).</i></b><i>\"</i> Wait, what "
"the heck is <a id=\"a1\">Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)</a>?!? Well, it's a line in the state of California's set of regulations that defines personal information as,<i> \"any information that "
"identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, a particular individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, signature, social security number, physical "
"characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, "
"bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information, or health insurance information.\"</i> Holy cow! Dang if that doesn't cover "
"pretty much anything personal Honda/Acura' could hope to collect about you! All conveniently hidden in a gibberish sounding code in their privacy statement. So much for those principles of \"data "
"minimization\" and \"transparency.\" Also, why would Honda/Acura' say they can collect things like your \"medical information\" for their \"legitimate business purposes\"? Perhaps they need to limit"
" that personal information collection a little?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"That's not all Honda/Acura says they can collect on you either. They also say they can gather even more information about you from data brokers, marketing agencies, the government, and lots and lots"
" of information from your car and those connected services. Things like information about your trips \"including trip start time and end time, trip start and end location, trip distance, and fuel "
"consumed,\" how fast your drive, search content, and \"geolocation information meaning the exact location of your vehicle at a specific point in time or over a period of time.\" The good news is, "
"Honda says they won't disclose your geolocation information with third parties or use it for their own marketing purposes without your consent. Sounds good, right? You're not going to consent to "
"that so you're covered, right? Well, wait a minute. Honda/Acura also says, \"You accept the terms of this Vehicle Privacy Notice, and consent to our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of "
"information as explained in this Vehicle Privacy Notice, when you: Purchase or lease a vehicle equipped with Connected Vehicle Technologies and Services; Use Connected Vehicle Technologies and "
"Services; Subscribe, register, or provide any information to us in connection with an attempt to subscribe or register for any Connected Vehicle Technologies and Services; Agree to the terms &amp; "
"conditions of any Connected Vehicle Technologies and Services; or Accept or enable data transmission, collection, or analytic services on a vehicle or connected smart device.\" So, does that mean "
"when you buy a Honda you've consented to all this nonsense? Or when you provide some information in an attempt to subscribe to their connected services but stop before you finish, you've now "
"consented to all this nonsense? The way their privacy statement is worded, it sure seems like that could be the case. That means your consent for Honda/Acura to use some very personal information "

"<i>\"We disclose Covered Information to third parties who provide goods or services that may benefit vehicle owners, including insurance companies, Honda/Acura dealerships, and consumer goods or "

" security vulnerabilities is bad. Our research also didn't find any good way to report security issues to Honda, which means Honda does not meet our Minimum Security Standards. A company that says "

"it were easier to actually keep Honda from collecting a ton of data on you. They do outline a list of choices, or opt-in/opt-outs, in their privacy policy. That is good, choice is good. However, we "
"are concerned that these opt-outs options are rather hard to determine, and we wouldn't be surprised if Honda pushes consumers into opting-in rather than making it easy for them to remain opted-out."
