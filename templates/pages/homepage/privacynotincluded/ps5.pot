"Sony's PS5 is finally easier to get your hands on than it has been in recent years, so this may be your moment to play \"without limits,\" as they say. Especially as old trusty (or big clunky, as "
"original PS5 owners can relate) will soon earn vintage status since Sony’s releasing a lighter version -- which has already earned the nickname “Slim” -- just in time for the holidays. But whether "
"you go with the classic console or its slimmed down successor, one thing’s for sure: its beefed up power and high-quality output makes games like God of War, Horizon Forbidden West, and the brand "
"new Spiderman 2, fast and beautiful. If only your trusty PS5 were better at privacy. Ah well, here's to a web slingin' good time and hoping your Sony doesn't overshare your personal information."

"Not gonna lie, this privacy researcher loves her PS5. I also recognize it collects and shares lots of information on me. Things like name, email, phone number, location, and lots and lots of device "
"information and info on how much I game (not that much, really, I’m too busy reading privacy policies), when I game, how good I am at gaming (pretty terrible, actually). Sony knows what obstacles I "
"jump in a game, what levels I reach, who I play against, how many times I die, and more. Am I worried Sony knows I’m terrible at racing games, while kinda obsessed with Kassandra from Assassins "
"Creed Odyssey? No, not really. But maybe it’s hard for me to get worked up about the privacy of my gaming history knowing that <a id=\"a1\">cars can collect</a> information about my heartbeat, "

"Also with the PS5, Sony now <a id=\"a1\">records all voice chats</a> in order to combat abuse during online gaming. Users experiencing abuse can submit recordings--no more than 40 seconds--of "

"potentially remove any of that content. This <a id=\"a2\">tug-of-war between privacy and safety feels</a> mostly fine to us, because something needs to be done about abuse in online gaming, "
