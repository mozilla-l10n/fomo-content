"This smartwatch comes from Chinese tech manufacturer Huawei and tracks all things standard fitness trackers do â€” heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleeps, stress, steps, calories and more. While "
"available in Europe, it might be hard to find these products in North America because of the ban on Huawei products in the US over privacy and security concerns. We did find that the collection and "
"use of health-related data is not described in their privacy policy and the privacy policy link on their webpage links to an old privacy policy last updated in 2018. The support email they offer for"
" the US is now defunct."

"Huawei's technology is basically blocked in the US. Many other countries around the world have issued bans on some of its technology. What does that mean for Huawei's fitness bands that are still "
"popular in Europe and elsewhere around the world? Huawei meets our Minimum Security Standards, which is good. Their privacy policy says they do not share personal data with other companies or "
"organizations without legitimate interest. What counts as a legitimate interest feels open to interpretation. A flag for us was how they collect and use of health-related data is not described in "
"the privacy policy. That's an important omission. For users in the US, the privacy policy on the web page links to an old privacy policy last updated in 2018. The Google Play store linked to a more "
"recent privacy policy. The multiple privacy policies led our research to email what turned out to be a now defunct email address: SupportUSA@huawei.com. Not really confidence inspiring."
