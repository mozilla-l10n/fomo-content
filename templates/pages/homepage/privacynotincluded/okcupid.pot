"Way back in 2007, OKCupid was one of Time's top 10 dating apps. Launched in 2004, OKCupid has over 50 million users around the world. To sign up, you fill out a personality test and give your "
"personal information. Based on that personality quiz, OKCupid's algorithm shows you a measurement of compatibility with potential matches. It's basically a percentage score that represents how "
"likely OKCupid's algorithm thinks you are to click with someone. With no real transparency into their algorithm, who knows how accurate their compatibility measurement is. Good news though, you can "
"also pay extra to have your profile shown to more users just in case. As their slogan says, \"Dating deserves better.\""

"OKCupid joined the likes of Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and Coffee Meets Bagel in that crowded gang in 2020 when researchers found a number of security flaws in OKCupid that could let attackers steal "
"users' personal information, view their private messages, and hijack a user's account and pretend to be them. OKCupid has also been called out in a recent Norwegian Consumer Council study that found"
" OKCupid may be sharing users' personal information like location, sexual preferences, and behavioral data with third parties and other Match Group brands in ways that may violate privacy laws. "
"Finally, Match Group owns OKCupid and at least 45 other dating sites like Hinge, Tinder, and Plenty of Fish. When you sign up with one of these dating sites, the Match Group privacy policy states "
"they may share your personal information with any of the other Match Groups sites for what they say are non-commercial limited and critical purposes. That's a lot of personal data you might have "
"thought only going to once place getting shared across multiple dating sites. Without a lot of transparency into the algorithm, one concern when apps collect this information is it's hard to know "
"how you might be matched and whether the apps have any potential bias. Security flaws, poor privacy practices, sharing data with who knows who, lack of transparency in their algorithms -- OKCupid "
"maybe isn't the worst dating app for protecting users' privacy we've seen (looking at you Grindr), but it’s not great."

"<br/>\"With a reputation for being a highly data-driven company, OkCupid has relied on its machine learning algorithms to connect people. A higher match percentage means that a couple will have a higher likelihood of clicking, with different weights given to different questions. But beyond simply producing matches, OkCupid also incorporates machine learning as a community improvement tool. Its support &amp; moderation team monitors machine learning alerts that detect harmful or abusive language. With the aid of technology, OkCupid can respond quickly to instances of harassment while bringing in human moderators on an as-needed basis\""
