"Tracking health biometrics has its merits. And wearing a watch 24/7 can be cumbersome. Oura makes a ring that tracks your health stats and aims to help you sleep better and feel better. And it seems"
" the rich and famous--from Prince Harry to the NBA, WNBA, and more--have taken a shine to this little ring. It tracks sleep, steps, calories, as well as heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, "
"inactive times, and even naps. And they've rolled out even more health stats--that measure your stress level, allow you to quickly journal your mood and mental state with help from AI, and one that "
