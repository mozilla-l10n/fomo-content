"If widespread mentions on the Internet are to be believed, artificial intelligence sex dolls are the wave of the future. And Realdoll hopes to lead the way. Their Realdoll X app lets you customize "
"your \"perfect companion\" with personality traits like talkative, funny, spiritual, and intellectual so you can talk, flirt, and maybe even fall in love with your AI companions. Buy the Realdoll X "
"head of your dreams to match your perfect AI love interest. That's customizable too -- everything from eye color to hair style to mouth shape. Now attach your AI driven sex doll head to the body you"
" customize, pretty much everything is customizable on the body from the neck on down. The doll can move its head, form expressions, blink and speak. Welcome to the future...we guess?"

"There is a whole lot we just can't tell about what's going on from a privacy and security perspective with the RealDoll X. The app that controls the doll isn't available for review and there was no "
"privacy policy for it we could find. The only privacy policy we could find was for the RealDoll website. The company did not respond when we reached out to ask for more specifics. All of this is a "
"red flag for us for a talking, learning, sex doll that lets you select the personality you want. The company says the artificial intelligence used in this doll learns over time, by analyzing user "
"conversations and actions. The more you talk to her, the more the AI bot learns. If the data from those conversations and actions is stored somewhere and then compromised, that's a lot of very "
"personal, very intimate information potentially exposed about any user of these sex dolls. What could go wrong? Well, what if the sex doll you requested has a jealous personality and learns all "
"about you and what makes you jealous? That information is stored somewhere on the internet and is accessed by hackers. Now the world could know what conversations you have with your jealous sex doll"
" and that just sounds really creepy."

"The company claims the Realdoll sexbot has thousands of conversational branches which provide the bot with a range of subjects and languages it can discuss. The more a user talks to her, the more "
"the AI bot will learn. The dolls also come with a variety of personality traits, such as jealous, moody or insecure. We were unable to tell much more about the AI used in this sex doll as there was "
