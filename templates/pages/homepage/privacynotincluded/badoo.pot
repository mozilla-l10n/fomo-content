"Available in 190 countries and 47 languages, Badoo is the world's most used dating app. Launched in 2006, Badoo now has nearly half a billion users, the majority found in Europe. Targeted at teens "
"and young adults, this dating and hookup app requires users to verify their identity by logging in with a social media account like Facebook or by linking it directly to their phone number. It also "
"required photo verification to use most features. Free users get access to most of the app's features like location-based matches, messaging, and seeing who visited your profile. Badoo even has a "
"free \"Lookalike\" feature that allows users to upload a picture of their celebrity crush. Badoo then uses facial recognition AI to find people who look like that crush. Top celebrity crush searches"
" included Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, and Donald Trump. Uhm.....really?"

"Badoo's privacy policy states, \"While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our website, member database and records no website or internet transmission is completely"
" secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.\" This is a good reminder that, even though Badoo doesn't seem to have some of the "
"terrible data and privacy protection practices of some other dating apps, they still ask you to give up a ton of personal information and don't guarantee that personal information will be protected."
" We also noticed their strong password game is pretty weak. We tried to log in with 12345. The app told us this is a very common password and asked us to add a letter. Upon adding only one lower "
"case letter, we were in. Those aren't the worst password requirements we've ever seen. They aren't great either. Finally, Badoo asks users to connect their accounts to Facebook. If you do that they "
"can then collect a ton of information on you, including your email, name, profile picture, date of birth, a list of your friends who also use the app, pages you have liked, location and photos. You "
"may also show up on your friends’ Facebook apps as a Badoo user. Remember, when you connect a social media account like Facebook to Badoo, both Facebook and the Badoo now potentially collect more "
"information together. That's why we recommend users don't link your dating app to Facebook. What's the worst that could happen on Badoo? Well, if you use a weak password to sign in and your buddy "
"figures that password out they could say tell Badoo your celebrity crush lookalike is Donald Trump and then you could be shown matches for people who look like Donald Trump over and over on the app."
