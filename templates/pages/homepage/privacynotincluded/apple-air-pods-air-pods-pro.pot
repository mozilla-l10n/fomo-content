"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. But, like life, hackers find a way! So Apple has had some pretty serious security issues. In 2023, Apple released fixes for <a "
"id=\"a1\">three</a> <a id=\"a2\">different</a> <a id=\"a3\">vulnerabilities</a> that made it possible for bad actors to hack Apple devices. <a id=\"a4\">In 2022</a>, they had a security flaw that "
"could allow hackers to take complete control of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Earlier that year, Apple also <a id=\"a5\">gave up data</a> to hackers who forged emergency data requests from law "
"enforcement. Eesh. Back in 2021, another bad <a id=\"a6\">security vulnerability</a> could have allowed bad actors to record calls and messages and even turn the device camera and microphone on "
"without the user knowing. Eesh. The good thing with Apple and security is, they seem to take these security breaches seriously, jump and fix them immediately, and communicate pretty well with users "
"on what they need to do to stay safe. So keep those devices updated, folks!"

"Apple says they can collect things like name, email address, age, location, device information, contact information, and more. The good news is, Apple says they treat all this information as "

"What’s the worst that could happen? Well, Apple <a id=\"a1\">isn’t perfect</a>, they could <a id=\"a2\">do better</a>. And this is a good time to remind people that Apple’s privacy policy -- as do "
"almost all the privacy policies we read -- has a clause that says, “We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is "
"reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.” So, while Apple is pretty good now, there is no"
" guarantee that Apple won’t reorganize their business or change their privacy practices in the future. Then that personal information you trust them with now could become more vulnerable or more "
