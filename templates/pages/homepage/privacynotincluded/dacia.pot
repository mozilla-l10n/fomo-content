"Dacia is a Romanian car company <a id=\"a1\">founded</a> in 1966. In 1999, the company was sold to France-based Renault Group. Dacia sells most of its cars in Europe and Northern Africa. Models "
"include the Sandero, Jogger, and Duster. Their <a id=\"a2\">Dacia Media Control app</a> let's owners of Dacia connect their phone to their car and do things like navigate with Waze, find where you "
"parked your car, and receive an alert if you forget your phone in your car. How is Dacia at privacy? Well, being a European-based car company covered by Europe's stronger privacy laws sure seems to "
"help. As far as we can tell, they aren't so bad. Our biggest worry is that we couldn't confirm if they encrypt all the personal data stored on their cars."

"They do, like the rest of the car brands, collect a lot of personal information about you like your name, address, and your vehicle’s VIN number. They also collect data about your driving and what "

"They're a bit more vague than some of the other car makers about the actual data points they collect. In their <a id=\"a1\">UK Privacy Notice</a>, they list the categories of personal data they can "

"we're nosy as heck -- it’s our job! So for example, Renault Group collects “Data related to your personal and/or professional situation (family situation, socio-professional category, etc.)” Pretty "

"They do say that they will ask for your consent when your geolocation is collected. Great! But that’s something Renault Group must do to comply with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation "
"(GDPR). It’s the law. And that’s the thing about reviewing a European car brand. Like we mentioned, because the GDPR offers pretty strong privacy protections, any car company focused on Europe is "
"going to have better privacy practices by default than brands serving countries, like the United States, with no federal data protection. On that note, you do have the right to get access to and "

"We feel that all that data Renault Group can collect about you when you communicate with them, sign up for their services, and purchase or drive their vehicles is more than enough. So we don't like "

"in line with your <a id=\"a1\">commitment</a> to data minimization, Renault Group. More on those commitments, Renault Group sometimes shares your personal information in ways that don't seem totally"
" necessary, or in their words, for \"explicit, legitimate and determined purposes.\" For example, they say then can share it with “[a]ny associated or connected motor manufacturer from whom we "
"purchase or hire goods (and their group companies)” and \"partners.\" It’s also not clear to us whether they will only share your personal data with law enforcement when they are legally obligated "

" not looking amazing for one of the “good ones,” we know. Yet we still have one last beef (or should we say beouf?) with Renault Group. They're part of a <a id=\"a1\">strategic alliance</a> with "
"privacy-monster Nissan, one of the worst car companies we reviewed a privacy. What does that mean exactly for the fate of your personal data? Well, probably not much thanks to the strong legal "
"protections in place. Still, given these companies’ cozy relationship, we’ll take it as a cautionary tale for what Renault Group might do if they could. Bravo, privacy laws! Finally, even though "
"we're getting déja-vue writing this, it’s our duty to tell you that Renault Group, like all of the other car brands we looked at, comes with *privacy not included."
