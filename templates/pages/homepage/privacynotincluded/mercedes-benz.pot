"\"Enter your comfort zone,\" says Mercedes website when you drop it to check out their cars (and privacy policies). Few car brands are more synonymous with luxury than German car manufacturer "
"Mercedes-Benz. They makes luxury cars, sports cars, Sprinter vans, as well as commercial vehicles. Mercedes-Benz history includes founder Karl Benz <a id=\"a1\">credited</a> with creating the first "

"Today they sell models with names like GLS, V-Class, electric cars in the EQ family, and the ritzy, pricey Maybach. Users can connect to their Mercedes-Benz cars through the <a id=\"a1\">Mercedes me"

"your car on the map, and see your car's data like tire pressure, fuel level, and more. So, how does Mercedes-Benz do at privacy? Well, turns out their privacy practices aren't great -- in fact, we'd"

"So yes, Mercedes admits that understanding the privacy and security of their vehicles is complicated and their solution is to send you off on a privacy policy scavenger hunt with a hardy <i>\"Good "

"California and Virginia in the US or their international privacy policy, the Mercedes me app privacy notice, their Mercedes me Connected Vehicle Services privacy notice, and more<i>.</i> We feel "
"super sorry for consumers who care about privacy and want to learn more before buying a Mercedes. We recognize most people don't have days to track down, read, and understand all the privacy "

"And Mercedes does indeed say they collect a good deal of information on you and your car, including <i>\"information reflecting your preferences, characteristics, predispositions, behavior, "

"license number, internet searches, browsing history, lots of geolocation information about you and your movements, purchasing tendencies, sensory data (<i>\"including audio, electronic, visual, or "

"What does Mercedes-Benz say they can do with that personal information, car and location data, and inferences? Well, for one, they say they can share, and possibly even sell, some of it to "

"Yeah, TikTok isn't exactly known to be a privacy-respecting app, so having it pre-installed on your car seems...not great. Now is a good time to remind you that Mercedes-Benz's own connected vehicle"
" services <a id=\"a2\">privacy notice</a> states, <i>\"Please note, however, that no information system is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</i>\" A good reminder"
" that your information is never really safe out there anywhere on the internet. And when a car and app and connected services collects SO MUCH information, well, yeah...it's depressing to consider "
"that not being safe and secure, isn't it<i>?</i><br/><br/>What's the worst that could happen as you drive your sweet Mercedes-Benz with the Mercedes me app and connected services around town? Well, "
"back to that part of their privacy policy where they say they can share <i>\"sensory data,\"</i> -- things like audio, video, and other electronic sensing information from your car -- with law "
"enforcement and government agencies. That sort of things starts to feel pretty creepy to us when you consider all the potential ways governments and law enforcement could overreach and abuse that. "
"Driving to an abortion clinic from a state in the US that bans abortion to one that doesn't? It's possible law enforcement could force Mercedes-Benz to give up your location and use that information"
" to prosecute you for seeking reproductive health care. Live in a country where authoritarian leadership takes over the government and demands the ability to track people they deem political "
"adversaries? Again, it's not too far fetched in our ever-growing world of connected cars that Mercedes-Benz could be compelled by the government to turn over location data or \"sensory information\""
" they can collect on you. We do want to be clear that these sorts of concerns are ones we have for all connected cars with similar privacy policy language regarding sharing with government and law "
