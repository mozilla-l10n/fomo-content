"Wysa describes itself as \"an emotionally intelligent chatbot that uses AI to react to the emotions you express.\" Launched in 2016 by founder Jo Aggarwal, who discovered <a id=\"a1\">bots were "
"easier to talk to</a> when dealing with her own depression, the app says it offers \"a mood tracker, mindfulness coach, anxiety helper, and mood-boosting buddy, all rolled into one.\" Along with "
"Wysa's AI chatbot, the app also offers in-app text-based chat sessions with real, live therapists. Wysa offers some free access to their AI chatbot. To access more features, users can choose between"
" <a id=\"a2\">two subscription options</a>, a lower cost option with access to the tools, or a higher cost option for access to the tools and coaches. So, how does Wysa's privacy look? We're happy "
"to say, Wysa's privacy <a id=\"a3\">looks pretty dang good</a>! They seem to be one of the rare mental health apps that isn't looking to make money off your personal information. Good work Wysa!"
