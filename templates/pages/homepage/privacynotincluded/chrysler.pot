"The <a id=\"a2\">Chrysler app</a> and the UConnect connected services lets you do all the remote things like remote start/stop, lock/unlock, honk the horn, flash your lights, and access navigation "

" up for us, <i>\"We do not sell or share personal information or sensitive personal information about California consumers who we know are younger than 16 years old.\"</i> So, if you are under 16 "
"and live in California, you might be good for privacy. Otherwise, eh..maybe not so much. For the rest of us they say, <i>\"As defined by the CCPA, we may sell or share: identifiers, usage data, "

"Chrysler/FCA <a id=\"a1\">says</a> they can collect a massive amount of personal information and vehicle data on you from your Chrysler, the Chrysler app, and the <a id=\"a2\">UConnect connected "

"search history, biometric identifiers, such as fingerprints or facial templates, and more. Oh, and then they say they can also collect more data on you from third party sources such as data brokers,"

"They also say they can collect a lot of data about you and your car. Things like <i>\"performance data, and other sensor data generated by your Vehicle, images, and event data generated in "

" Amazon Alexa), and images captured in connection with vehicle camera record.\"</i> Then there's all the driving data they say they can collect on you. Things like, \"<i>speed, acceleration and "
"braking data; direction of travel; trip data (e.g., mileage, date, time, weather conditions, location, route taken); ignition events; steering events; cruise control data; seatbelt status; "

"And then they go on to say they can use much of this personal information and car data to draw inferences about you <i>\"to create a profile reflecting an individual’s preferences, characteristics, "

"interests and your location, target you with what they call relevant ads, and personalize content to you to keep you using, and paying for, their services. That profile they create on you from all "
"this data is quite valuable to them, and to other third parties, who want to know as much about you to try and sell you more stuff. In that vein, Chrysler/FCA say they can share -- or even sell -- "
"that information to a large number of service providers, business affiliates, subsidiaries, marketing partners, data brokers, car dealers, etc etc on and on and on. None of this is good for you (or "

"And don't hold your breath that you'll be able to get all that data Chrysler/FCA collects on you deleted. Their privacy policy doesn't clearly state that users who don't live under strong privacy "
"laws like California's CCPA or Europe's GDPR can get their data deleted. And their Google Play Store <a id=\"a1\">Chrysler App page</a> where they list their Data Safety information, Chrysler "
"clearly states, <i>\"Data can’t be deleted: The developer doesn’t provide a way for you to request that your data be deleted.\"</i><br/><br/> Shoot, even if you decide to deactivate those connected "
"services for privacy reasons it might not mean Chrysler/FCA actually stops collecting your data for those connected services. Indeed, their <a id=\"a2\">UConnect connect services privacy policy</a> "
"says, <i>\"Expiration or termination of your Connected Services subscription does not automatically stop all collection of Covered Data from your Vehicle.\"</i> They go on to say, if you actually "
"want them to stop collecting your data for privacy reasons you have to jump through even more hops like calling both SiriusXM and the vehicle connected services department separately and directly to"
" have your connected services stop sending Chrysler/FCA your data. And then they add this little gem, \"<i>If you cancel for privacy reasons, wireless transmission network service will be "
"deactivated for your Vehicle once your request has been processed, which means that: (i) remote transmission and collection of Covered Data from your Vehicle will be stopped; (ii) most Connected "
"Services will not be available to you, including emergency and roadside services and Wi-Fi-enabled services; and (iii) your Vehicle will no longer receive updates to your in-vehicle manual or other "
"over-the-air updates.\"</i> So yeah, basically you can jump through many hoops to have Chrysler/FCA stop collecting your data for privacy reasons, but that means your Jeep's emergency and roadside "
"services will no longer work and you'll no longer receive updates to your car's software, which we're assuming means it could stop functioning correctly or fix security vulnerabilities as they come "
"up. Not cool FCA, not cool. People should be able to opt out of data collection and still keep their security features if they want."

"Speaking of security vulnerabilities. While Chrysler/FCA's track record at protecting and securing all that data and connected services seems better now, back in 2015, they became the first car "
"company forced to issue a recall of their vehicles based on a cybersecurity threat. Then, <a id=\"a1\">Wired first reported</a> how two hackers were able to exploit vulnerabilities in a FCA-owned "
"Jeep Cherokee entertainment system to take remote control of the car. Then they could do everything from mess with the air conditioning to turn the radio on and off, to stop the car's acceleration. "
"That report eventually <a id=\"a2\">resulted in FCA issuing</a> a <a id=\"a3\">recall of 1.4 million vehicles</a> to fix the security vulnerability. That's the bad news. The good news is, we "

"One other thing we'd like to note about Chrysler/FCA (and this applies to every company that says they de-identify your data, not just Chrysler/FCA). The Chrysler/FCA privacy policy states, <i>\"We "
"may collect, use, and disclose aggregate, anonymous, and other non-identifiable data about users for marketing, advertising, research, compliance, or other purposes. Where we use, disclose, or "
"process de-identified data (data that is no longer reasonably linked or linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person, household, or personal device), we will maintain and use the "
"information in de-identified form and not to attempt to re identify the information, except as permitted by applicable privacy laws (such as to confirm whether our de-identification processes are "
"reasonable and adequate).\"</i> It is fairly common to see lines in company privacy policies that say similar things to this -- the company can collect data, de-identify it, and then use it however "
"they want and keep it for as long as they like. Generally, this can be OK. However, we would like to warn that <a id=\"a1\">researchers have found it can be relatively easy to re-identify</a> some "
"personal data that has been de-identified, especially if location data is involved. What can you do about this? Well, you can ask for your data to be deleted frequently, that could help. But not "
"everyone has the same rights to that. So the best option is to limit the personal information and location data a company collects on you as much as possible. We know this is easier said than done, "
"especially with cars. Which is why we sure hope policy makers and regulators will step in soon to help consumers better protect their privacy."

"So, what's the worst that could happen as you're cruising around in your Chrysler while using your Chrysler app and those UConnect connected services to stay online on your minivan road trip? Well, "
"we're sure glad they fixed those security vulnerabilities they had back in 2015 that allowed hackers to take control of your car and stop it and more through UConnect system. That's pretty much a "
"worse case scenario if that could happen again. Other than that, well, Chrysler/FCA knowing way more about you than they should, sharing that with data brokers who can then sell that to who knows "
"who for who knows what purpose, well, that gets pretty scary too. Especially if they learn you like to take your minivan to the mall every Friday while listening to Taylor Swift on the radio and "
"looking up news articles on the hottest TikTok fashion trends. That might set you up for way more targeted ads than you and your family could possibly afford."
