"Let’s talk for a minute about Alexa itself. While your Kindle doesn't come with Alexa built-in (yay!), nearly everything else Amazon sells comes with their helpful artificial intelligence as part of"

"to <a id=\"a1\">automatically delete voice recordings</a> immediately after they are processed. That's a nice feature after the controversy around<a id=\"a2\"> human reviewers listening</a> in to "
"Alexa voice recordings. However, Amazon says when you delete your voice recordings, they still can keep data of the interactions those recordings triggered. So, if you buy a pregnancy test through "

"Oh, let’s not forget Amazon’s track record at protecting and respecting their customers' data. That raises some red flags too. Here are a few of the problems we’ve seen over the last few years. "

" (there could be more unknown ones as well). And we get it, Amazon is a huge company with many products and employees and it’s impossible to secure everything's 100% of the time. But that’s the "
"point. When you collect such a vast amount of personal information on people, you’ve got to be super, duper, extra careful to secure it everywhere, all the time. Amazon has shown they can’t always "
