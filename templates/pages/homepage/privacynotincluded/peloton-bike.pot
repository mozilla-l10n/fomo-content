"Getting outside to exercise can be hard. Which has made Peloton's connected exercise bike a must have for those who can afford the $1,500+ price tag. The networked bike comes with a 20+ inch "
"touchscreen display that streams thousands of live or on-demand workouts. The Peloton app tracks your every drop of sweat to make sure you're burning enough calories for that creepy boyfriend (yeah "
"Peloton, we haven't forgotten your creepy boyfriend ad!). We do like that Peloton took quick action to shut down the spread of <a id=\"a1\">QAnon conspiracy theories</a> from their forums and "
"leaderboards. We don't like that they had to."

"Peloton became one of the go-to workout machines for those who could afford them during the pandemic. They’ve had a rough 2021 though. Here’s what happened. Peloton sells expensive treadmills "
"alongside their popular exercise bikes. Tragically, a <a id=\"a1\">6-year old was killed</a> in an accident on one of these treadmills. Due to safety concerns, Peloton <a id=\"a2\">issued a "
"recall</a> and added a feature called Tread Lock that requires a four-digit passcode to keep their treadmills from starting up for anyone without authorized access."

"Sounds great, right? <a id=\"a1\">Here’s the problem</a>. Peloton treadmill users needed that Tread Lock four-digit passcode to unlock their treadmill and Tread Lock required a $39 per month "
"subscription. If users cannot unlock their treadmill, they can’t use the machine at all. Peleton offered the Tread Lock subscription at no cost for three months and <a id=\"a2\">in August</a> "
"updated that so all Tread owners could access Tread Lock and Just Run without a subscription. This is good as many <a id=\"a3\">Peloton users worried</a> their costly treadmills would turn into "
"expensive towel racks - <a id=\"a4\">not something they signed up for</a> when they bought the treadmill. This issue of who owns and controls a connected device after purchase will almost certainly "
"be a growing concern in the years ahead. Especially with a company like Peloton, which makes quite a lot of money off the content sold to users of their workout equipment."

"As for Peloton’s privacy, they do a decent job. They say they don’t sell your personal information. They may share your information with third parties for marketing after they de-identify it, which "
"is normal and generally ok, although we should probably put out that <a id=\"a1\">many privacy researchers have demonstrated</a> how it can be relatively easy to de-anonymize such data. "
"Unfortunately, we could find no mention of their data retention or deletion policies. In early 2021, a bug in the Peloton system reportedly <a id=\"a2\">exposed personal user data</a> on their "
"servers, including gender, age, location, and more, to anyone on the internet. It appears to be fixed now, but what's not good is that it took Peloton more than three months — <a id=\"a3\">and a "
"call from a journalist</a> — to address the vulnerability, according to the security researcher who discovered the problem."
