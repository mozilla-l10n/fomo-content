"Peloton isn't just about bikes anymore. They also sell a couple of high-priced treadmills. Those big bucks get you a shock-absorbing treadmill with a 24 inch touch screen built in so you can feel "
"like you're running on the beach with your trainer when in fact you're stuck inside your apartment. Their app tracks your workouts and gives you access to things like yoga classes and strength "
"training too. Tragically, Peloton had to issue a recall on their Tread+ treadmills when a child was killed when they were pulled under the treadmill. The company also had to issue a recall on their "
"Tread treadmill because the console could detach and fall. Oof, 2021 was not a good year for Peloton Tread. Sadly, their privacy and security isn't so great either."

"Peloton became one of the go-to workout machines for those who could afford them during the pandemic. They’ve had a pretty <a id=\"a1\">rough</a> go of it since though. In early 2023, they agreed to"
" pay a $19 million <a id=\"a2\">civil penalty</a> for a flaw that resulted in a <a id=\"a3\">6-year old being killed</a> in an accident on one of their treadmills back in 2021. Worse, the United "
"States Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that Peloton was aware of “incidents associated with pull under and entrapment in the rear of the treadmills, including reports of injuries” before"
" that design flaw ended in tragedy. The CPSC also said that company staff claimed Peloton continued to distribute the dangerous treadmills even after they <a id=\"a4\">recalled it</a>. (If you have "
"one of these machines, you can now <a id=\"a5\">request</a> a safety guard <a id=\"a6\">from Peloton</a> that will be available in early 2024.)"

"After the incident, Peloton did add additional safety features including a four-digit passcode to keep their treadmills from starting up for anyone without authorized access. Sounds great, right? "
"Unfortunately they added a paywall too which meant unless you paid a subscription fee, your pricey Peloton could turn into an <a id=\"a1\">expensive towel rack</a>. They did <a id=\"a2\">reverse</a>"
" that decision and <a id=\"a3\">unlock</a> the “Just Ride,” “Just Run,” and “Just Walk” features plus a limited number of pre-recorded classes per month for “non-members.” But this issue of who owns"
" and controls a connected device after purchase will almost certainly be a <a id=\"a4\">growing concern</a> in the years ahead. Especially with a company like Peloton, which makes quite a lot of "
"money off the content sold to users of their workout equipment."

"And Peloton isn’t out of the woods yet regarding the safety of their machines. They had to issue <a id=\"a1\">another recall</a> in mid-2023 for their bikes -- because the seat post can break or "

"As for Peloton’s privacy, they aren't exactly stellar there either. They say they don’t sell your personal information for money. In their <a id=\"a1\">U.S. States Privacy Notice</a> for states with"
" stricter privacy laws, like California and others, they clarify that some of the ways they share might be considered a sale according to those laws, referring specifically to website cookies and "
"tracking technologies. That's pretty standard stuff, but still not the best. They do say they can share sensitive personal information (like age and gender), how you use your Peloton (like class "
"performance history and leaderboard rank) as well as geolocation with third party advertising partners. That’s not cool. In their general <a id=\"a2\">privacy policy</a>, they do say they will only "
"share your “Fitness Data” in aggregated and anonymized format, which is normal and generally ok, although we should probably put out that <a id=\"a3\">many privacy researchers have demonstrated</a> "
"how it can be relatively easy to de-anonymize such data."

"Security-wise, there have been some blunders too. In early 2021, a bug in the Peloton system reportedly <a id=\"a1\">exposed personal user data</a> on their servers, including gender, age, location,"
" and more, to anyone on the internet. It appears to be fixed now, but what's not good is that it took Peloton more than three months -- <a id=\"a2\">and a call from a journalist</a> -- to address "
"the vulnerability, according to the security researcher who discovered the problem. Recently, in the summer of 2023, it was <a id=\"a3\">reported</a> that Pelotons may still have a number of "
"security issues that could allow bad actors to get access to sensitive information. Eesh."

"What’s the worst that could happen? Well, a child dying is pretty much the worst thing that could happen. We hope nothing like that ever happens again. As for what's the worst things that could "
"happen from a privacy perspective...well, we sure hope Peloton gets their security act together because their pricey treadmills do come with cameras and microphones included and no one needs to hack"
" into those and watch you grunting away during your workout."
