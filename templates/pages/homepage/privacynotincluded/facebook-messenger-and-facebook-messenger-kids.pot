"Facebook Messenger has features like video chat, the ability to record voice messages, text chats, group chats, photo, video sharing and a feature called Messenger Rooms that allows up to 50 people "
"to chat over video at once even without a Facebook account. Messenger Kids is a messaging app targeted at kids under 13 who are not yet old enough to join Facebook. It lets kids video chat and "
"message their friends through their parents' Facebook account. Facebook is pretty well known for vacuuming up users' personal data, including stating in its privacy policy it can use the camera "
"feature to collect data on you. The company does say it won't use the content of your messages to serve you ads, so there's that. And with more kids stuck at home, using Messenger Kids to connect "
"remotely with their friends, it’s always good to beware of Facebook’s poor track record protecting their users’ privacy."

msgid ""
"With Facebook-owned apps we always worry there is a good deal that could go wrong. Facebook has a long history of not handling people's personal data with care. In 2019, Facebook confirmed a report "
"that it hired contractors to read and transcribe audio messages users sent through Messenger and Facebook. And earlier in 2021, the personal data of over 500 million Facebook users--information like"
" phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and, in some cases, email addresses--was publicly posted on a hacker forum. Facebook says it doesn't use the content of "
"messages to choose which ads to show you. But Facebook makes no such claim about the other types of insights tucked inside your messaging app — who you're speaking to, when you speak to them, and "
"other types of metadata. Facebook sucks up a great deal of this type of data to use for ad targeting and reserves the right to share it with numerous third parties. There are no ads served to kids "
"in Facebook Messenger and Facebook claims they don’t use data from the Messenger Kids app for ads in their other apps. It does still collect children’s data though, so be wary, as you’re trusting "
"Facebook with information about your young children. Also, Facebook markets the Messenger Kids app to children under the age of 13, so parents who let their young children use Facebook Messenger "
"Kids should pay close attention to what their kids share. All in all, if you do decide to use Facebook Messenger, it’s probably best to assume nothing you say or do is actually private."

"Facebook provides a privacy policy which is written in a simple language, in a Q&amp;A format. An additional policy is issued for Messenger Kids. However, it provides rather vague answers to some "
"important questions (e.g., types of data collected, ways to delete the data without deleting the profile, etc.). The nature and volume of sharing of data to third parties is also unclear from the "

"In August 2019, Bloomberg reported that Facebook hired contractors to transcribe audio messages users sent through Messenger and Facebook confirmed the report. In April 2021, it was reported that "
"there was a personal data leak of about 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in "
"India. It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and, in some cases, email addresses. In January 2021, Google Project Zero security researcher Natalie "
