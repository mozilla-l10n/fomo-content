"\"Help a monster friend with big feelings learn to calm down and solve everyday challenges.\" Yes please! Elmo and the gang at Sesame Street's app, aimed at parents and caregivers of kids aged 2-5, "
"is designed to help the young ones learn how to calm down, learn self-control, and expand their emotional vocabulary. The app is bilingual in English and Spanish, research-based, and free to "
"download and use. How does this app do from a privacy perspective? Well, good and bad. The app itself doesn't seem to collect much personal information. However, Sesame Workshop, which makes all the"
" apps for the Sesame Street gang, well, their <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> does raise privacy concerns for us."

"When we first reviewed Sesame Workshop's Breath, Think, Do app in 2022, we found a few concerns -- their privacy policy was last updated in 2013, we couldn't confirm they meet our Minimum Security "
"Standards, and no one responded to the questions we sent to the email address listed in their privacy policy for privacy related questions. After publishing our review, Sesame Workshop reached out "
"to us and made some important changes to their privacy and security practices. They acknowledged no one had been monitoring the privacy question email address, and said they would fix that. They "
"established an email for people to report security vulnerabilities in their apps, and they updated their privacy policy. We were quite happy with how willing they were to improve their privacy and "
"security practices."

"Unfortunately, in 2023 Sesame Workshop has updated their privacy policy to one that leaves us with some pretty serious concerns. In fact, this app, and all apps covered by Sesame Workshop's privacy "
"policy, now earn our *Privacy Not Included warning label. The things that concerns us most are the fact that they clearly state in their privacy policy they can collect data on you from data brokers"
" and other third party sources, <i>\"We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources, including our data broker services, data enhancement companies, list rental services, third-"
"party analytics providers, and social media-owned databases...\"</i> They go on to say they can use all this information they collect about you to make inferences about you <i>\"to generate "
"information about your likely preferences or other characteristics.</i>\" Uhg...comes on Sesame Workshop! Can't you just let us play with Elmo and the gang without trying to know our "

"Anyway, the good news is, the Breathe, Think, Do with Sesame app itself doesn't require a log in to start using, so it is likely not collecting much or any personal information at all. So, you are "

"collection, combination, and inference trends chipping away at our privacy everywhere on the internet these days."

"We're not too worried about the privacy of Sesame Workshop's mental development app for young children. The privacy policy does say that sometimes personal information like name and email might be "

"educational non-profit, so they aren't trying to make money off you or your child's data, which is a breath of fresh air."
