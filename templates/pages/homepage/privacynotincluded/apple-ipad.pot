"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. But, like life, hackers find a way! So Apple has had some pretty serious security issues. In 2023, Apple released fixes for <a "
"id=\"a1\">three</a> <a id=\"a2\">different</a> <a id=\"a3\">vulnerabilities</a> that made it possible for bad actors to hack Apple devices. <a id=\"a4\">In 2022</a>, they had a security flaw that "
"could allow hackers to take complete control of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Earlier that year, Apple also <a id=\"a5\">gave up data</a> to hackers who forged emergency data requests from law "
"enforcement. Eesh. Back in 2021, another bad <a id=\"a6\">security vulnerability</a> could have allowed bad actors to record calls and messages and even turn the device camera and microphone on "
"without the user knowing. The good thing with Apple and security is, they seem to take these security breaches seriously, jump and fix them immediately, and communicate pretty well with users on "
"what they need to do to stay safe. So keep those devices updated, folks!"

"Apple says they can collect things like name, email address, age, location, device information, contact information, and more. The good news is, Apple says they treat all this information as "
"personal information. So, things like device ID and the like are treated as securely as your name and age. That‚Äôs good. And any information used to personalize things for you across your Apple "
"devices is synced over iCloud using end-to-end encryption. Also good. They do say they can share your data with some third parties such as business partners, service providers, and others as you "

"And when it comes to AI voice assistants, Siri is a bit more privacy conscious than others like Amazon‚Äôs Alexa. Apple says they <a id=\"a1\">take special care</a> to make sure your Siri requests "
"aren't associated with you, and those transcripts aren‚Äôt subject to human review--<a id=\"a2\">anymore</a>. In 2021, Apple made another <a id=\"a3\">positive change</a> for your Siri voice requests"

"Apple <a id=\"a1\">isn‚Äôt perfect</a>. In January 2023, Apple was fined <a id=\"a2\">eight million euros</a> by France‚Äôs data protection authority because they determined that <a id=\"a3\">in "
"2021</a>, Apple‚Äôs iOS 14 didn‚Äôt comply with EU privacy requirements. The complaint said its default settings allowed targeted ads from Apple without asking users for consent. Regulators agreed. The "

"What‚Äôs the worst that could happen? Well, this is a good time to remind people that Apple‚Äôs privacy policy -- as do almost all the privacy policies we read -- has a clause that says, ‚ÄúWe may also "
"disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or"
" users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.‚Äù So, while Apple is pretty good now, there is no guarantee that Apple won‚Äôt reorganize their business or change their privacy practices "
"in the future. Then that personal information you trust them with now could become more vulnerable or more valuable. Here‚Äôs hoping Apple keeps being one of the better ones out there though. ü§û"
