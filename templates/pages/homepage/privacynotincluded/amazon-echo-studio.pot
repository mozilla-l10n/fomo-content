"\"You've never heard an Echo like this before,\" claims Amazon with their new high end smart speaker. Designed to compete with better sounding speakers like the Apple Homepod Mini and Sonos smart "
"speakers, this chunkier, better sounding version of the Echo Dot comes with 5 speakers, 3D soundscape, spatial audio processing and room adapting technology, as well as plenty of ways to listen to "
"what you say with those smart microphones. The Echo Studio can act as a smart home hub and control all those Amazon Alexa connected lights, plugs, Fire TV sticks, cameras, locks, thermostats, and "
"more. Amazon claims this fancy speaker is also \"designed to protect your privacy\" with a microphone off button and the ability to ask Alexa to delete those voice recordings you just made. That's "
"all well and good, but we'd caution anyone in thinking Amazon is a privacy respecting company. They just love your data and it's good to remember that."

"id=\"a2\"> human reviewers listening</a> in to Alexa voice recordings. However, Amazon says when you delete your voice recordings, they still can keep data of the interactions those recordings "
"triggered. So, if you buy a pregnancy test through Amazon Alexa, Amazon won't forget you bought that pregnancy test just because you ask them to delete the voice recording of that purchase. That "

"So, what’s the worst that could happen? Well, if you happen to order that pregnancy test through Alexa, Amazon now knows you might be pregnant. Then comes the ads for baby clothes, diapers, cribs, "

"they just know that you were likely pregnant and now likely not. Setting aside the scary post-Roe vs Wade world we live in now where this information could be used by law enforcement, think of the "
