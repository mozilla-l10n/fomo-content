"If money is no object, then Apple TV 4K could be right for you. It comes with all the bells and whistles -- that means things like 4K HDR with Dolby Atmos sound. You'll be able to streams from "
"standards like Netflix and Disney+ and rent or buy movies as well. You'll also get access to Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, and Apple Arcade. Oh, and you can connect the FaceTime app "
"through your iPhone or iPad to FaceTime on your big screen. So much better to see Gramma with. And if you like talking to Siri, just ask Siri to find you something good to watch."

"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. But, like life, hackers find a way! So Apple has had some pretty serious security issues. In 2023, Apple released fixes for <a "
"id=\"a1\">three</a> <a id=\"a2\">different</a> <a id=\"a3\">vulnerabilities</a> that made it possible for bad actors to hack Apple devices. <a id=\"a4\">In 2022</a>, they had a security flaw that "
"could allow hackers to take complete control of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Earlier that year, Apple also <a id=\"a5\">gave up data</a> to hackers who forged emergency data requests from law "
"enforcement. Eesh. Back in 2021, another bad <a id=\"a6\">security vulnerability</a> could have allowed bad actors to record calls and messages and even turn the device camera and microphone on "
"without the user knowing. The good thing with Apple and security is, they seem to take these security breaches seriously, jump and fix them immediately, and communicate pretty well with users on "
"what they need to do to stay safe. So keep those devices updated, folks!"

"On the privacy front, Apple does collect data about what you watch, purchase, or download on Apple TV as well as things like name, email address, age, location, device information, contact "
"information. Apple will use this data to offer personalized recommendations for other shows to watch and target ads to you on Apple platforms like in the App Store or Apple News. They do give you "
"the option to opt out of both these forms of data collection, which is great. And Apple says they share some non-personal information with the makers of shows to help them see how their shows are "
"performing and pay out royalties. In the streaming TV world, this is all pretty standard and maybe even a little less scary than other companies like Roku who seem to share (even sell) your data "

"And when it comes to AI voice assistants, Siri is a bit more privacy conscious than others like Amazon‚Äôs Alexa. Apple says they <a id=\"a1\">take special care</a> to make sure your Siri requests "
"aren't associated with you, and those transcripts aren‚Äôt subject to human review--<a id=\"a2\">anymore</a>. In 2021, Apple made another <a id=\"a3\">positive change</a> for your Siri voice requests"
"--many audio requests for things like setting timers or alarms or controlling music are no longer sent over the internet to their servers, instead they are processed directly on your Apple TV. This "

"All in all, yes, Apple is generally better than other Big Tech companies (cough, Meta, cough cough, Amazon, cough Samsung), when it comes to privacy. They seem to do a better job at collecting less "
"data, probably because they aren‚Äôt trying to sell as many ads as Google and Facebook -- <a id=\"a1\">yet</a>. So when we hear that more <a id=\"a2\">ads are coming</a>, that does alert our privacy "
"Spidey Sense a bit. In early 2023, Apple <a id=\"a3\">hired</a> a TV advertising executive to ‚Äúbuild a video advertising business‚Äù for its companion streaming service with (confusingly) the same "
"name. What that will look like, we don‚Äôt yet know, but it <a id=\"a4\">might</a> be similar to Netflix‚Äôs cheaper ad tier ‚Äì in which case opting out of ad targeting may no longer be an option. For "
"now, we‚Äôre keeping an eye on Apple‚Äôs ad business ambitions with the hope that their public <a id=\"a5\">commitment</a> to privacy will outweigh the need to reap those extra ad dollars."

"Besides their burgeoning interest in the ad game, Apple still <a id=\"a1\">isn‚Äôt perfect</a>. In January 2023, Apple was fined <a id=\"a2\">eight million euros</a> by France‚Äôs data protection "
"authority because they determined that <a id=\"a3\">in 2021</a>, Apple‚Äôs iOS 14 didn‚Äôt comply with EU privacy requirements. The complaint said its default settings allowed targeted ads from Apple "
"without asking users for consent. Regulators agreed. The thing is, Apple <a id=\"a4\">could do better</a>. So it's important to hold them accountable for their privacy promises."

"What‚Äôs the worst that could happen? Well, this is a good time to remind people that Apple‚Äôs privacy policy -- as do almost all the privacy policies we read -- has a clause that says, ‚ÄúWe may also "
"disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or"
" users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.‚Äù So, while Apple is pretty good now, there is no guarantee that Apple won‚Äôt reorganize their business or change their privacy practices "
"in the future. Then that personal information you trust them with now could become more vulnerable or more valuable. Here‚Äôs hoping Apple keeps being one of the better ones out there though. ü§û"
