"Where to start with our concerns about Toyota's privacy practices? Maybe with the fact that Toyota promotes itself as very privacy friendly while doing too many things that are anything but. For "
"example, on Toyota's <a id=\"a1\">Privacy Hub</a>, they mention right off the top that they \"play a key role in the development and adoption of the <a id=\"a2\">Automotive Consumer Privacy "
"Protection Principles</a>.\" This sounds great, right? Well, it does until you look at it more closely. Those privacy principles were created by the automakers themselves back in 2014 to show they "
"were taking privacy seriously."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"However, if you look closely, you'll see that Toyota, and nearly all the automakers we reviewed, don't actually follow their own principles for privacy. Those include things like \"Data "
"Minimization\" (the idea they collected only what data is needed), \"Data Security\" (securing the data they do collect), \"Transparency\" (providing users clear, meaningful privacy information), "
"and \"Choice\" (offering users choice in how their data use and collecting, and \"Respect for Context\" (using and sharing information only for what it was collected). Our research shows that Toyota"
" (and pretty much every other car maker we reviewed who signed onto these principles) absolutely do not follow these promises at all. Toyota collects a ton of data -- way more than is likely "
"necessary, they admit to sharing and even selling some of it with third parties for their own marketing purposes, they've had security lapses that put their users' personal information at risk, and "
"they continue to expand their data collect to make more money off of the treasure trove of data they collect. Toyota isn't alone in this, but they are the ones bragging about playing a key role in "
"setting up automotive privacy principles that they themselves don't seem to follow."

"California's CCPA or the EU's GDPR. We can't confirm if Toyota grants everyone, everywhere the same rights to access, delete, and control their data though, which is not good. We would love to see "

"We also give Toyota some bonus points for having a <a id=\"a1\">North American Privacy Hub</a> where consumers can more easily track down some of the many privacy policies Toyota has that covers "
"their cars, apps, connected services, and more. But this outlines another gripe we have with Toyota. There are so many privacy policies, notices, statements, etc for all of their cars, connected "
"services, apps, on-board cameras, and more. Tracking them down was quite the task. We even learned that <a id=\"a2\">Toyota's app</a> for managing their connected car service works with all their "
"car brands -- except the Toyota Supra. Which has its own <a id=\"a3\">Toyota Supra Connect app</a> that, interestingly, links to BMW's privacy policy. It's quite the complicated privacy scavenger "
"hunt to track down all of Toyota's privacy documentation and make sense of it. We did our best, but it made our heads spins. Don't worry though, we found another Toyota slogan that applies here! "
"\"<i>Imagine a world without limits\".</i>..on the number of privacy notices we expect people to read. Shoot, Toyota even admits in their EU privacy policy that their privacy policy landscape is "
"quite complicated, <i>\"This Policy contains general rules and explanations. It is complemented with separate specific privacy notices relating to particular services, tools, applications, websites,"

"Toyota says they can collect a whole heap of personal information on you through your car, the Toyota app, and their connected services. This includes everything from personally identifying "

"steering, and breaking functionality, and travel direction, to lots of information about your car including VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), interior and exterior image data from cameras and "
"sensors in your car, facial geometric features. They even can collect sensitive personal information such as precise geolocation data, biometric information. On top of all this, they say they can "
"collect lots of information about you from other sources such as social media, public sources, data brokers, data providers, your friends, and more. Toyota is collecting a whole lot of information "

"not processing, or potentially even sharing, your sensitive personal information -- things like your precise geolocation data, biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying an "
"individual, and financial information. In fact, they qualify the use of that sensitive information in ways that leave us uncomfortable. They say, \"<i>Where required by law,</i> we will obtain your "
"consent before processing your sensitive Personal Information. We will also g<i>enerally</i> use your sensitive Personal Information for limited purposes...\" This vague, qualifying language about "

"Toyota's ecosystem of parent companies and affiliates, dealers and distributors is also vast. These include things like Toyota Financial Services and your local \"dealer advertising associations.\" "
"These are all places Toyota says they can share your personal information. We also found <a id=\"a1\">Toyota Connected Europe</a>, which seems to be a Toyota-affiliated data business that uses all "
"the vast amounts of data cars, car apps, and car mobile services can collect to develop better connected cars, understand driver behavior better, make cars safer (yay!), help drivers develop more "
"energy efficient driving behavior, and more. Some of these things are very useful and beneficial to society. Some of them might not be. And remember, Toyota is in the business of selling more cars, "
"and thus, collecting more data to sell more cars. Toyota Connected Europe describe data as follows: \"I<i>t’s the lifeblood of our business and powers everything we do.\"</i> We share this as a "
"reminder that for car companies like Toyota, data is a huge and growing business as cars become ever more connected (Toyota Connected Europe describe themselves on their web page as a \"young "
"business\".) Guess what, we've got another Toyota slogan that applies here! \"<i>You are what drives us.\"</i> Another way of saying your data is what drives our business (to be fair, data is what "
"drives most businesses these days…unfortunately for privacy it's the way the world now works).<br/><br/>Toyota does love their slogans. They say, P<i>eace of mind comes standard.</i> Well, maybe not"
" so much when it comes to their track record of protecting and respecting all that personal information they collect. They have a couple of serious security lapses over the past few years that raise"
" eyebrows. In May, 2023 <a id=\"a2\">Toyota admitted</a> that it had left the location data of <a id=\"a3\">over 2 million Toyota and Lexus users</a> exposed and unsecured for ten years. A couple "
"weeks later, <a id=\"a4\">Toyota again admitted</a> it left the data of another 260,000 car owners exposed in a different security incident. And back in 2020, <a id=\"a5\">security researchers found"
" flaws</a> in the encryption for the car keys that let drivers start their cars in Toyota vehicles. Hyundai and Kia car keys were also found to have the same flaws. These security and privacy "
"oopsies on Toyota's part don't exactly give us a lot of peace of mind that they truly understand what it takes to protect all that information they are collecting on us as we drive their cars. In "
"fact, they themselves warn in their <a id=\"a6\">Connected Services privacy policy</a>, <i>\"Please note, however, that we cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of any information "
"transmitted to us by you or your vehicle. Your use of your vehicle’s Connected Services and App Suite is at your own risk.\"</i> Is that what Toyota was going for with their slogan. <i>\"The power "
