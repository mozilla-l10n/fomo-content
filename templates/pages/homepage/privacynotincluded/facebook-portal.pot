"Let's be honest, Facebook has a pretty terrible track record when it comes to protecting their user's privacy (remember that record $5 billion dollar fine for privacy failures?). Now they're asking "
"people to drop a couple hundred dollars to put a device with an AI-powered smart camera capable of tracking your every move and an Alexa-powered, always listening microphone in your home. What could"
" go wrong? Given Facebook's terrible track record on privacy, we're worried a lot."

"Facebook has a history of betraying users' privacy and trust. They've faced record fines for this and have been caught hiding privacy breaches from their users. Just as recently as September, 2020, "
"90 million Facebook user accounts may have been impacted by a security issue where attackers were able to take over these accounts. This is the starting point for bringing a device with an AI-"
"powered smart camera and always listening microphone that is sending data back to Facebook regularly into your home. Facebook also says they do human review of audio snippets unless you opt out. The"
" question comes down to, does Facebook have your best interests at heart when it collects all the data this device is capable of collecting? In the past—from Cambridge Analytica and beyond—the "
"answer to that question has way too often been, NO. We're afraid this device comes with *Privacy Not Included."

"Facebook says that it does not use anything you say on a Portal video call or voice interactions for targeted ads, but data about your Portal usage – how often you do video calls, what apps you "

"Facebook collects and may review voice data from interactions with the Portal. The Portal also has an AI-powered \"SmartCamera\" that tracks you as you move in the video frame during a call. These "

"class-action lawsuit is pending against the company for violating an Illinois biometrics law by using facial recognition without explicit consent."
