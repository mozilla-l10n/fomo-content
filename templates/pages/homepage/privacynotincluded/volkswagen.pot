"Famous for the happy little VW Beetle and the iconic VW Bus, Volkswagen is a German car manufacturer with a worldwide reach. Current models include the Jetta, Passat, Golf, Rabbit, Tiguan, Taos, and"
" electric vehicles like the ID.4 and the ID Buzz. Volkswagen's <a id=\"a1\">myVW</a> app lets users of VWs built since 2020 (VW says they are working on adding functionality for vehicles 2019 and "
"older) connect to their suite of connected car services either called Car-Net or We Connect (<a id=\"a2\">depending on where you live</a>). Through the myVW app you can do things like remote start, "
"lock, and unlock the car, honk your horn from afar to scare the pants off your friends, find your car in the parking lot when you can't remember where you parked it, and even keep tabs (read; spy) "
"on your car when someone else is driving it. Handy! And maybe a little creepy. So, how does VW fair at privacy? Well, let's just say their privacy practices aren't nearly as cute as those little VW "
"Beetle's were."

"Here's the deal: Privacy at Volkswagen doesn't look very good to us. VW earns all three of our privacy dings for how they use data, for how people can control their data, and for their track record "
"at protecting the data they collect and we could not confirm them meet our Minimum Security Standards. Not good. Our privacy worries are even more concerning when you consider the vast ecosystem of "
"things VW uses to collect your personal information -- from your car, to the Car-Net or We Connect connected services, to the myVW app users can use to interact with the car, to the personal "
"information your VW dealer can collect on you, even during a test drive, to the additional information they can gather or buy on you from outside sources like data brokers, to the inferences they "

"And then VW says they can share that personal information in lots of places, including throughout their large Volkswagen Group of companies. And VW freely admits in their privacy policies they share"

"forget, nearly all privacy policies mention how personal information can be shared with governments, law enforcement, and with any company that buys them in a merger or sale. So, yeah, when you "
"drive a VW (or honestly, just about any car we review), lots and lots of your personal information is collected, stored, shared, used for targeted advertising, and open to being leaked or abused. "

"In their <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>, VW says they can collect a ton of personal information about you (seriously, they have a handy chart at the end that lays it all out neatly). VW collects "

"What does VW say they can do with this vast treasure trove of personal information, car data, and inferences they collect on you? Well, they use it to make more money, of course. Because selling "

"personalized and targeted advertising purposes or those or their affiliates, business partners, or other third parties. They can share it with third parties who can use it for the commercial purpose"
" of marketing their products and services to you. They also say they can use or disclose your de-identified data for <i>\"any purpose.\"</i> Which is OK, as long as they do a good job actually de-"

"Here's something else to worry about (sorry for being such a downer). VW is probably not the only company collecting lots of information on you when you're in your VW car, especially if you're using"

"to help you find places in your area, to Parkopedia if you're looking for a parking spot to those streaming radio providers if you listen to music in your car. Your connected car is potentially "

"So, VW collects a TON of data, uses this data for lots of things including combining it with even more data they can collect on your from data brokers, social media sites, and more to build a big "

"spotty track record at respecting and protecting all that personal information they collect on their users. From <a id=\"a1\">reports</a> of security concerns from a respected consumer watchdog to "
"<a id=\"a2\">firing employees</a> for serious cyber security concerns, to a <a id=\"a3\">big old data breach</a> that saw the <a id=\"a4\">personal information of 3.3 million users</a> compromised "
"and then <a id=\"a5\">offered up for sale by hackers</a> resulting in a <a id=\"a6\">$3.5 million class action settlement,</a> to major fines for <a id=\"a7\">privacy violations during test "

"So, what's the worst that could happen to your privacy with your VW car, myVW app, and VW's Car-Net or We Connect mobile services? Well, dang, let's see. It would really suck if VW leaked that "
"personal and location data they collect on you and hackers on the dark web could buy it and know all the places you like to visit and when you visit them and use that to stalk you. That wouldn't be "
"great. But heck, there's a risk data brokers might be able to collect and sell some of that same information from VW and legally sell it to others who want to target you with all sorts of ads. "
"That's not great either. And shoot, it seems like law enforcement and governments might also be able to get their hands of some of this data too. To be fair, this is a problem with nearly all car "
"brands, not just VW. The fact remains, VW might have a history of making cute cars, but their privacy practices in 2023 are anything but cute. It's probably good to assume your VW comes with "
