"\"Take a deep breath\" Those are the first words you see when you open this meditation app. Then you hear the soothing sounds of rain in the forest or waves at beach. Ahh... feeling calmer already. "
"Calm is a popular app to meditate, relax, and help you fall asleep. Your stressed out privacy researcher here at *Privacy Not Included has actually relied on it for a number of years to help keep "
"the anxiety of reading all these privacy policies at bay. Unfortunately, this researcher didn't actually read their privacy policy until doing our research for these mental health apps. Yes, there "
"are some stressful things in there. The good news is Calm has been one of the better companies we've worked with to try to improve their privacy a bit."

"When we launched our review of Calm in 2022, the app initially earned our *Privacy Not Included warning label. We dinged them for their data collection and use practices and for how users could "

"After meeting with the folks over at Calm, they agreed to make a significant change to their privacy policy to make it clear all users, regardless of what privacy laws they live under, have the same"
" rights to access and delete their data. Their privacy policy now reads, <i>\"Subject to certain limits and conditions provided under law, we honor the exercise of the right of access or deletion "
"for all of our users, regardless of their location. Any Calm user may exercise this right by contacting us at support@calm.com.\"</i> People, that line there is a thing of beauty! You've no idea how"
" hard it is to convince companies to include wording like that in their privacy policies. So, good work Calm! Thank you."

"Calm isn't perfect. They do still collect a fair amount of personal information, including gathering data on you from third parties sources like marketing and advertising partners and social media "

"UPDATE June, 2022: Here's a thing Calm did to help calm this stressed out privacy researcher's frazzled nerves a little. After we launch our review, we had some productive conversations with them "

"privacy laws -- the same rights to access and delete their data. This is progress. Thanks Calm."

"Uhg...Calm, why oh why must you ruin our zen meditation vibe with stressful privacy practices? You know what's rather stressful? When a company says, \"Calm uses your data to personalize your online"

"calming privacy <a id=\"a3\">practices</a> at all. Then there's this (unfortunately) common practice where they say they \"also share aggregated or other information not subject to obligations under"
