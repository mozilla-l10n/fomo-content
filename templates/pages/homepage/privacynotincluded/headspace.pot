"Headspace says their mission is to improve the health and happiness of the world. Founded by a <a id=\"a1\">former monk</a> who also seems to have a love for the circus, Headspace offers guided "
"meditation and mindfulness tips as well music from John Legend to help you fall asleep. This popular app -- the <a id=\"a2\">company claims</a> over 70 million members in 190 countries around the "
"world -- says it wants to be 'your mind's best friend,\" which sure does sound nice. Seems your mind's best friend also might like to collect and share your data with places like Facebook and Google"
" though so maybe hold off on that BFF label for now."

"<b>First reviewed April 20, 2022. Review updated, April 25, 2023</b><br/>Well dang. In 2022, Headspace was one of the few apps we reviewed that actually did NOT receive our *Privacy Not Included "
"warning label. Unfortunately, in 2023, it looks like Headspace has taken a step backward. This year they earned two privacy dings from us. First, for our concerns about how they say they can share "
"some personal information with third parties, including Facebook, to target ads. We have that same concern this year. This year are also unable to confirm based on Headspace's <a id=\"a1\">privacy "
"policy</a> that all users, regardless of what privacy laws they live under, have the right to access and delete their data. Boo! So, it looks like in 2023 Headspace's privacy practices have gotten a"
" bit worse. Headspace now earns our *Privacy Not Included warning label. Bummer."

"Headspace does collect some personal data on users, including -- name, e-mail address, phone number, divine information, app usage data, and Facebook ID -- although seemingly not as much as some of "
"the other mental health apps we reviewed. Still, they collect your personal and app usage information and say they can share that information with third parties like Google and Facebook to target "
"advertising and make personalizations within the app. Unfortunately, this is pretty standard practice for apps like this in our current data economy. Still, it's not great if you care more deeply "

"Does it matter if Facebook knows when you use a meditation app, if Google knows where you use the app, or <a id=\"a1\">if Headspace knows</a> you're searching for a meditation to help you prepare "
"for a big exam? It could. What's the worst that could happen? Well, here's a <a id=\"a2\">blog from Headspac</a>e talking about how they are developing machine learning applications to use your data"
" in real-time to offer \"recommendations that engage our users with new relevant, personalized content that builds consistent habits in their lifelong journey.\" New, consistent habits could also be"
" interpreted as keeping users using the app as much as possible. One idea they mention in this post is to use users' biometric data such as steps or heart rate to then recommend in real-time more "
"content to get them moving or exercising. OK, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But what more could a company potentially learn about you and do with that data? Perhaps learn your emotional state?"
" Your anxiety level? And then target more content or advertising to you when you're more vulnerable? We don't think this is currently happening with Headspace. But the title of this section is "
"\"what could happen if something goes wrong?\" And it seems, now or in the future, there are many things that could go wrong with this sort of vast data collection, processing, and the "
"personalization and ad targeting that follows."
