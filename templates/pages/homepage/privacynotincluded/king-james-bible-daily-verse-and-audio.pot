"There are a number of Bible apps available with tens of millions of downloads and <a id=\"a1\">reportedly questionable</a> privacy practices. We couldn't review all of the Bible apps out , so we "
"picked one to review to give users an idea of our concerns and what they should look for when choosing a Bible app. iDailybread's King James Version Bible app has over 50 million installs on the "
"Google Play store alone. It is a wildly popular app that says it \"keeps God’s teaching at your fingertips\" by allowing users to study, read, and listen to the Bible at any time as it can be used "
"without internet access. The app is free to download and <a id=\"a2\">offers a $5</a> a month subscription to use ad-free."

"Our concern is <a id=\"a1\">flags have been raised</a> about who is really behind this app. It seems the company is a hard-to-pin-down mobile gaming organization located in Hong Kong and their "
"privacy policy does raise some concerns for us about where your personal information is going and how exactly it is used. We'll just add, with all apps, including Bible based apps, users should do "
"their research before downloading."

"What worries us about iDailyBread's King James Bible app? Well, for starters, it's concerning to us the company making the app is a bit of a mystery. iDailyBread is <a id=\"a1\">reportedly</a> a "
"Chinese mobile gaming company, and some such companies have a history of creating apps that do a lot of data collection. We raise this concern because there have been a number of <a "
"id=\"a2\">reports</a>, including this<a id=\"a3\"> Buzzfeed News</a> piece, laying out how too many Christian apps have targeted users for potential data profiteering, preying upon those who pray."

"With that caution in mind, what did we find in iDailyBread's privacy policy? For starters, it's a pretty short, sometimes vague policy. They do say they can collect personal information such as name"
" and email. They collect device ID and GPS location from you as well. They go on to say they combine the information they collect on you with additional information from third parties to \" provide "
"you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services\" which we assume could include targeted advertising, personalization and more. The company also says they allow third-party "
"companies to \"collect and use non-personally identifiable information during your time in the app in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to "
"you.\""

"So they are collecting your information and sharing information with third parties for advertising purposes targeted at your interests. This isn't great and might not be what you expect when you "
"download a Bible app to help with daily Bible study. As for opting out, they say \"You may decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case we may not be able to provide "
"those services to you.\" Which could mean you can chose not to give them your information if you chose not to use their services."

"There are some concerning things missing from the app's privacy policy too. Nowhere does iDailyBread specifically state that they don’t sell user data, which is something we like to see stated "
"clearly. They also make no mention of how they handle children's data collection and privacy, which is another red flag for an app targeted at \"everyone\" in the app store. One other red flag we "
"really don't like, the only option to login to the app seem to be by using your Facebook or Google logins, which means these ad companies can collect even more data on you and your Bible app usage. "
"We here at <i>*Privacy Not Included</i> recommend never using your social media account logins for other applications."

"None of these flags make us feel good about your privacy as you use iDailyBread's King James Bible app. Maybe going old school is better with your Bible study? Advertisers, marketers, and data "
