"Nissan is a Japanese headquartered global car company that traces its roots back to the early 1900s and the Datsun name. Today, they manufacture cars like the Rogue, Pathfinder, Murano, Versa, "
"Sentra, Altima, the Titan truck, and their electric LEAF. Their MyNissan app lets owners remotely start and stop, lock and unlock their car, as well as hock the horn, flash the lights, check your "
"fuel and tire pressure, keep tabs on where you car is, if it's in the boundaries you set up or going over the speed limit you set for it, and access other NissanConnect connected services. So, how "
"is Nissan at privacy? We're not going to mince words here: THEY STINK AT PRIVACY! They are probably the worst car company we reviewed and that says something because all car companies are really bad"
" at privacy."

"Believe us when we say this: Nissan's privacy policy is probably the most mind boggling creepy, scary, sad, messed up privacy policy we have ever read. And we here at *Privacy Not Included read a "

"Here's why: They come right out and say they can collect and share your <b>sexual activity, health diagnosis data, and genetic information</b> and other sensitive personal information for targeted "
"marketing purposes. We absolutely aren't making that up. It says so in their <a id=\"a1\">Nissan USA privacy notice</a>. And that's not all! They also say they can share and <b>even sell</b> "
"\"Inferences drawn from any Personal Data collected to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences, characteristics, <b>psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, "
"attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes</b>\" to others for targeted marketing purposes. Yes, Nissan says they can infer things like how smart you are, if you have a predisposition to "
"drink, if you are acting depressed, and if you are any good at chess (we're guessing that's what they can infer..it could be even worse than that), and then they say they can make as much money off "

"Whoo! That was a lot. But there is another point we'd like to make about this bonkers language in Nissan's privacy policy. Yes, Nissan sucks for saying they can collect, share, and even in some "
"cases sell all this super intimate personal information. Here's the thing though, there is a pretty high probability other car companies are also collecting, sharing, and selling this exact same "
"stuff. They just aren't as open and honest about it in their privacy policies. Too often we read privacy policies that say things like, \"We will share your personal information, <i>for example</i>,"
" your birth date or favorite ice cream flavor, with third parties for targeted advertising purposes.\" We see lots of lines like, \"for example,\" \"might include\" and \"as well as other "
"information\" in privacy policies and this vague language could very well be hiding the fact that these companies also collect personal information like your sexual activities and your genetic "
"information. We too often <i>just don't know</i>. So yes, while Nissan absolutely sucks for claiming this bonkers level of data collection, sharing, and selling in the name of profit, we'll give "
"them this: At least they are honest."

"Is there more bad about Nissan? Well of course there is. If you decided to download the MyNissan app to do things like remotely honk your horn at your neighbor's kid whenever they get too close to "
"your car while outside playing, you might stumble upon the Data Safety Information they provide on their <a id=\"a1\">MyNissan Google Play Store app page</a>. And when you read the self-reported "
"data safety information Nissan provides you might see a couple things jump out at you. First, Nissan claims, \"<i>No data shared with third parties: The developer says this app doesn't share user "
"data with other companies or organizations</i>.\" Well, we can certainly confirm that this is not true. Nissan clearly states in their privacy policy they share your personal information, car usage "
"data, and other information with lots of marketing and promotional partners, car dealers, business affiliates, service providers and more. That's not good. Bad on Nissan for not being fully honest "
"in their self-reporting of this data safety information. And bad on Google for not doing a better job requiring accurate information and policing this data safety content. (We did some research "
"earlier in 2023 that shows just how big a problem the Data Safety Information is in the Google Play Store. You can <a id=\"a2\">read it here</a>. TL;DR: Don't trust it!). The other thing that jumped"
" out at us on the Data Safety page was this statement, \"<i>Data can’t be deleted. The developer doesn't provide a way for you to request that your data be deleted.</i>\" Yeah, that's really bad. "
"Not being able to delete the huge amounts of data this app could collect on you is bad news."

"Oh yeah, here's something else you should know about Nissan (although Nissan isn't the only company to say things similar to this). If you use their connected services, you better be prepared to "
"tell every single person who gets in your car all about how much data they collect and why. Yup, Nissan puts all that on you. Their privacy policy specifically states that, \"<i>By activating, "
"registering, subscribing, or using any of the services offered by NissanConnect, or by</i> <b><i>operating or occupying a vehicle that is utilizing such services you agree</i></b><i> to Nissan "
"collecting and using the information collected for various purposes as described in this Privacy Notice and in the NissanConnect Services Subscriber Terms and Conditions.\"</i> Yes, just by sitting "

"and System features and limitations, the terms of the Agreement, including terms concerning data collection and use and privacy, and the Nissan Privacy Policy.\"</i> So Nissan owners, get to work "
