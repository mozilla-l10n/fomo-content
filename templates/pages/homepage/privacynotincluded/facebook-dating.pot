"The good thing about Facebook Dating is it's one of the few completely free dating apps out there. The bad thing about Facebook Dating is that it's Facebook, which has a terrible track record at "
"protecting their users' privacy and personal information. So, what do you get with Facebook's free dating service, questionable privacy practices aside? You use Facebook Dating, launched in 2019, "
"through your existing Facebook app, no need to install a new app (warning though, the Facebook app collects a lot of data on you if you chose to install it). Create a dating profile in the Facebook "
"app and away you go. Facebook will match you with people within a 100 miles of where you are. Facebook uses all the data it has on you (which is a lot) to find matches for you based on what you "
"like, who your friends are, and what hobbies you're into. There's no swiping left or right. Instead if you find someone you want to chat with, you must ask them a question based on their profile or "
"pictures. It's good Facebook Dating is free, as not everyone can afford to pay a lot of money to use a dating app. It's bad the trade off is Facebook and their questionable privacy practices can now"
" collect even more personal information about you."

"Let's be honest, Facebook has a long history of betraying users' privacy and trust. They've faced record fines (remember that $5 billion dollar fine for privacy failures?) and have been caught "
"hiding privacy breaches from their users. Now they're asking people to give them even more personal information to help them find love. What could go wrong? Given Facebook's terrible track record, "
"we're worried a lot. Facebook Dating isn't a seperate app, it is part of the general Facebook app, and it is well established that the Facebook app tracks a whole lot of user information like when "
"you visit a coffee shop (if you don't turn off location sharing) and what is going on in the photos you share. Add in the additional personal data you share to create your Facebook Dating profile "
"like gender identity and if you smoke, and now Facebook has even more personal information on you they can use for somewhat questionably ethical ad targeting practices. The question becomes, does "
"Facebook have your best interests at heart when it collects all the data their dating service is capable of collecting? In the past—from Cambridge Analytica and beyond—the answer to that question "
"has way too often been, NO. There's a reason Facebook Dating is free, you're paying for it with your privacy."
