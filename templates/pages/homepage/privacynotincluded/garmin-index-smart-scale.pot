"Let's be honest, tracking all those steps with a fitness wearable is nice. Seeing the benefits of all those steps when you take that step onto the scale is much nicer. Garmin's Index Smart Scale "
"gives you a way to bring all those metrics -- weight, body mass index, body fat, skeletal muscle mass and more -- together. Pair up this WiFi and Bluetooth connected scale with the same app your "
"Garmin fitness tracker uses -- the Garmin Connect app -- and you've got all your fitness and body info right there in one place. And best of all, Garmin looks pretty good from a privacy perspective."
" Now get stepping."

"When your *Privacy Not Included researcher wanted to get a fitness tracking smartwatch to see how stressed out reading privacy policies made her, Garmin is what she went with. Because Garmin seems "
"to do one of the best jobs handling the privacy and security of all the personal data fitness trackers collect, at least according to their really not that stressful <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>."

"Here’s what this privacy researcher really likes about Garmin. Yes, Garmin's smart scale can collect a whole lot of personal information through the device and on the <a id=\"a1\">Garmin Connect "
"app</a>. That’s what smart scales are designed to do, that's why we want them. Garmin says they can collect data like email address, device information, location, and all that body-related data like"
" how much you weigh, your BMI, and more. Here's the thing. Garmin might collect lots of data, but they then do a pretty good job, as far as we can tell, of respecting it, protecting it, and not "
"trying to make money off sharing or selling it. Gasp! What a wonderful idea."

"Your “sharing with others” user settings in the Garmin Connect app are set to “private” by default. Which is great. You can choose to share your data with contacts if you wish, but you have to "
"change your privacy settings to do that. Good work Garmin. Garmin says they don't sell data and they don't share your personal information for advertising purposes with third parties without your "
"consent. They ask you to opt-in rather than opt-out of consent to receive marketing communications from them. And their privacy policy is actually pretty good at laying out what data they collect, "

"Garmin has been on our Best Of list for a number of years. And we're pleased to say, in 2023, it seems they've gotten even better (which is amazing when so many other companies are getting worse). "
