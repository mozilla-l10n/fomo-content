"Tinder is the app that made swiping right for love--or a hook up--popular. Launched in 2012, Tinder is now one of the most popular dating apps on the planet. Profiles are quick and easy to set up "
"with your picture being the most important thing. Users see your profile pictures and either swipe right to like or swipe left to reject. If the person you swiped right on also likes you, you can "
"message each other and it's off to the races with your potential date. Tinder lets you connect via Facebook, add your Instagram, link your Spotify, or add your Snapchat. Tinder collects a whole lot "
"of personal data on users. And it's got a pretty bad track record of protecting that data. Also, Tinder's algorithm for matching has come under some heat for potential questionable practices such as"
" lowering the profile rankings of men who are free users and potentially charging users over the age of 28 more than younger users."

"Yeah, Tinder is pretty bad for your privacy and security. 70,000 women's photos from Tinder shared on a dodgy site known for criminal activity. Security vulnerabilities that made it possible for "
"attackers to monitor a user's every move on the dating app. Add in the fact that a Norwegian Consumer Council study recently found some of these Match Group sites may be sharing users' personal "
"information like your location and dating preferences to third parties and other Match Group brands in ways that may violate privacy laws, and you've got yourself a potential privacy mess.There are "
"just a few of the privacy and security problems Tinder has been accused of over the past few years. Match Group owns Tinder and at least 45 other dating sites like Hinge, Match, and OKCupid. When "
"you sign up with one of these dating sites, the Match Group privacy policy states they may share your personal information with any of the other Match Groups sites for what they say are non-"
"commercial limited and critical purposes. That's a lot of personal data you might have thought only going to once place getting shared across multiple dating sites.Oh, and remember, when you connect"
" a social media account like Facebook to Tinder, both Facebook and Tinder now potentially collect more information together. That's why we recommend users don't link your dating app to Facebook. "
"What's the worst that could happen? So many bad things have already happened on Tinder, we don't need to outline them here. Just head down to the updates section at the bottom of this page and read "
"some of them yourself."

"In early 2018, security researchers found that Tinder was lacking basic encryption for photos, as well as lacking basic HTTPS encryption on Tinderâ€™s iOS and Android mobile apps. In fact, in early 2020, Tinder suffered a serious data breach which resulted in more than 70,000 images of women being shared online. In addition to these data breaches, Norwegian regulators started investigating Tinder, alleging that the company shared personal user data with advertising companies that may violate privacy laws. \r"
