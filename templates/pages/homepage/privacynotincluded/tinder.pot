"Tinder is the app that made swiping right for love--or a hookup--popular. Since its launch in 2012, the world’s most popular free dating app wants you to know that it’s changed. They recently added "
"quizzes and profile prompts so that users can swipe (and match) on more than just photos. It’s a “rizz-first redesign,” they said! And their subscription tiers now include a pricey “Tinder Select” "
"option where, for $499/month, you can send messages to people you haven't swiped right on you and be seen by Tinder’s most “sought after profiles”--a weird promise from a company that says their "
"matching algorithm doesn’t rank users by desirability (anymore?). As always, Tinder also lets you connect via Facebook, add your Instagram and link your Spotify. All those extras mean Tinder can "
"collect a whole lot of personal data on its users. Unfortunately, from what we can see, they’re (still) not doing enough to keep all that personal information private and safe."

"Yeah, Tinder is pretty bad for your privacy and security. Back in 2020, over <a id=\"a1\">70,000 photos of women</a> from Tinder ended up on a dodgy site known for criminal activity. The same year "
"Tinder came under fire for possible <a id=\"a2\">GDPR violations</a> for what a Norwegian consumer group called “out of control” <a id=\"a3\">data sharing</a> with advertisers and third parties. In "
"2022, the United States Federal Trade Commission <a id=\"a4\">filed a petition</a> against Tinder’s parent company, Match Group Inc. to force them to hand over documents about a possible deal "
"between one of their apps and an AI company, where images of users’ faces were <a id=\"a5\">reportedly used</a> to train facial recognition software. Tinder was also hit with lawsuits about their "
"photo verification feature in 2022 and 2023. One says that Tinder didn't get proper <a id=\"a6\">consent</a> from users to process their biometric information and the other <a id=\"a7\">claims</a> "
"the feature “verified” a fake account created with the plaintiff's stolen photos. Yikes! Match Group's shaky track record makes us a little nervous about their eagerness to enter the <a "

"Besides security concerns and being the subject of Netflix’s <a id=\"a1\">most-watched documentary</a>, other controversies have kept people talking about Tinder. People started asking questions "
"about Tinder’s matching algorithm after their CEO at the time said it involves a secret <a id=\"a2\">“desirability” score</a>. It raised a lot of questions about <a id=\"a3\">discrimination</a>, <a "
"id=\"a4\">racial basis</a>, and (based on the bajillion articles written about how to reset, optimize, and overcome your “score”) probably made people feel bad about themselves. By 2019, Tinder <a "
"id=\"a5\">called</a> that scoring system “old news” and said they no longer “rely on it.” But their blog post on the topic raised more <a id=\"a6\">questions</a> than answers about how it all works "
"now. The post says that “Likes and Nopes [how people react to your profile] are obviously key pieces of insight into what members like” and are still taken into account for matching. Hmmm. What’s "
"not so obvious is how that’s so different and if the new way is less vulnerable to biases. People also had questions about Tinder’s wacky and inconsistent premium subscription pricing model -- "
"including Mozilla. We partnered with Consumers International to shine a light on the app’s confusing <a id=\"a7\">personalized pricing</a> that seemed to take age and other mysterious factors into "
"account. This, again, raised more questions about Tinder’s behind-the-scenes number-crunching in a way that felt icky. It took until 2022 for Tinder to <a id=\"a8\">finally announce</a> that they’re"
" phasing out age-based pricing for all markets. And in March 2023, following a lengthy dialogue with the European Commission and other consumer groups, <a id=\"a9\">Tinder finally committed to</a> "

"So Tinder and their parent company Match Group has not been known for their security or transparency. That’s a shame because, as a dating app, they sure can collect a lot of information about you. "
"There’s information you give about yourself when you set up your account like your contact information, gender, and who you’d like to meet. Your profile information, the photos you upload, your "

"choose to give Tinder access to biometric information (information about your unique face shape) if you want to be a Verified Cutie. Tinder can also collect more information about you from "
"“partners” and affiliates like other sites owned by Match Group -- that includes Hinge, Match, OKCupid, and dozens more. And they can create inferences about your “preferences, characteristics, "
