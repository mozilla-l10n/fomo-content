"Crossing paths and finding dates. That's the idea behind the location-based dating app Happn. Launched in 2014, Happn works by showing you other people on Happn who you have crossed paths with (and "
"by crossed paths, they mean come within 250 meters of). If you cross paths with someone who catches your eye, you can like their profile. Only if that person likes you back, what Happn calls a "
"Crush, can you then message them. Free users can access basic matching, sending likes, and chatting with a crush. Premium users get to remove ads from the app, set invisibility time so others can't "
"see them, and lock down privacy settings more tightly. Your phone number or Facebook is required to sign up."

"Good news! Happn isn't as terrible with your privacy as so many other dating apps. Bad news! They still share your personal information with a host of other companies. Good news! They at least tell "
"you who those other companies are and what they do with you data --  like Facebook, TikTok, and Snapchat who they use for things like \"Marketing operations to non-Members.\" This sort of data "
"sharing isn't uncommon, we still don't love it. Happn is a location-based app hoping to connect people who cross paths, much like Tinder and Grindr, and is way better than Tinder and Grindr at "
"protecting users privacy and security. Happn isn't perfect though. Users have the option to sign in with Facebook or their phone number. In 2017, Happn was found leaking users' Facebook information "
"like location, pictures, and identities because they weren't securing this data properly. There are always risks when you use Facebook to connect to your dating apps. So please remember, when you "
"connect a social media account like Facebook to Happn, both Facebook and Happn now potentially collect more information together. That's why we recommend users don't link your dating app to "
"Facebook, use your phone number instead. Because really, you don't need to share all your personal info with Facebook, and then Happn, and then Happn may share more with Facebook and then it all "
"gets exposed and soon the world knows where you like to hang out and who you think is hot. That might be a recipe for a good date...it's also potentially a recipe for disaster."

" AI, so that it doesn't take the 'magic' out of the equation but still uses AI to 'rank' profiles according to what it assumes a user will like.\""
