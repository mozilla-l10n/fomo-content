"One other red flag we wanted to note in Tesla's privacy policy (and this is something we see in too many privacy policies, to be fair). When it comes to sharing your personal information, they say "

"appropriate. We may also share information about you, where there are legal grounds to do so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use or protect our "
"operations or customers. This could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\"</i> The way that statement is worded, we are concerned the Tesla could voluntarily disclose"
" your personal information with law enforcement or governments, which is something we don't like to see. We prefer to see companies clearly state they will only share data with law enforcement and "
"governments under court order and that even then, they will limit the scope of what the disclose as narrowly as possible. Tesla can collect a lot of data on their users and the people around them. "
"Making sure that information can't be easily accessed by anyone, including law enforcement and governments seems pretty important to us. We would love to see Tesla improve this line in their privacy"
" notice.<br/><br/>Here's the bottom line with Tesla. Yes, their privacy notice and documentation say some things we like to see. They clearly state they won't sell your data. Good. They say they "
"won't share anything that personally identifies you with third parties for their marketing purposes<i> unless you opt-i</i>n. That's OK. We'd rather they not do that at all, of course, and we always"
" worry about how clear or confusing the opt-in consent process is. But, their privacy notice also has too many things in it we don't like to see. Really vague language, lack of clarity on sharing "
"(lots of we \"may\" do this thing, \"for example\" this), and they also seem to hide a lot of what they could be doing behind legal terms like \"fulfill other legitimate interests of Tesla.\" "
"Privacy notices written with these sorts of slick, legal language leave us privacy researchers feeling uneasy. That, combined with Tesla's poor track record at protecting and respecting their users'"
" privacy leaves us very worried about Tesla's privacy (no matter how much they mention in their privacy notice they care about your privacy, it's hard to trust them with their current track record "
"showing otherwise). Combine this with the fact we emailed the contact listed in Tesla's privacy notice for privacy related questions multiple times over the course of our research and never heard "
