"Garmin's Fenix line of watches -- which include solar versions, small and large versions, and even ones with super scratch resistant glass -- aren't cheap. You can drop $1,000 dollars on these "
"watches that do all the smart watch things like heart rate, pulse ox, respiratory rate, stress, sleep, and more. These shiny wrist gadgets also offer GPS navigation, topographic maps right on your "
"wrist, and a built-in flashlight just in case you still get lost in the dark. All this is great, but how about their privacy? Well, fortunately, Garmin's privacy is pretty good."

"When your *Privacy Not Included researcher wanted to get a fitness tracking smartwatch to see how stressed out reading privacy policies made her, Garmin is what she went with. Because Garmin seems "

"Here’s what this privacy researcher really likes about Garmin. Yes, Garmin's fitness trackers and smartwatches can collect a whole lot of personal information through the device and on the <a "
"id=\"a1\">Garmin Connect app</a>. That’s what a fitness trackers and smartwatch are designed to do, that's why we want them. Garmin says they can collect data like email address, device information,"
" location, and all that body-related data like physical activity, stress, sleep patterns, heat rate, pulse ox, and more. Here's the thing. Garmin might collect lots of data, but they then do a "
"pretty good job, as far as we can tell, of respecting it, protecting it, and not trying to make money off sharing or selling it. Gasp! What a wonderful idea."

"Your “sharing with others” user settings in the Garmin Connect app are set to “private” by default. Which is great. You can choose to share your data with contacts if you wish, but you have to "

"consent. They ask you to opt-in rather than opt-out of consent to receive marketing communications from them. And their privacy policy is actually pretty good at laying out what data they collect, "
