"What would the world be like without Mario, Zelda, and Animal Crossing? Worse, for sure. Whether you play Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch or on the cheaper Switch Lite, you're still going to have "
"a good time. And we've always liked that Nintendo puts a lot of emphasis on easy-to-use parental controls. Which is why we were bummed to see that Nintendo made some changes to their privacy policy "
"in recent years that earned them our *Privacy Not Included warning label. And we're sad to say, they still raise enough concerns for us to warn you that your privacy might not be smashing with "
"Nintendo."

"Oh Nintendo, you keep breaking our heart. We don’t want to give you our *Privacy Not Included warning label, we really don’t. You’ve been good at privacy in the past. But your <a id=\"a1\">privacy "

"Just because Nintendo is cute and lovable, doesn't mean we can give them a pass for their privacy yucks. First, Nintendo does collect a fair amount of personal information. Things like name, email "
"address, postal address, phone number, date of birth, country of residence, language, gender, device and advertising identifiers and other unique personal or online identifiers, location (with your "
"consent), health information (with your consent), and lots of information about how and when and what games you play."

"Nintendo also says they can <i>“receive information about you from other sources, including from other users of our services, and third-party services and organizations.”</i> This worries us a bit "
"because they say they can take this information they receive from third party sources and combine it with information they have about you and build an even bigger profile on you. And they say they "
"can use that information to do things like offer you customized content, provide you with tailored advertising, and send you promotional materials from them or their affiliates and business partners"
" (which could be a pretty good number of companies). So, Nintendo collects a good deal of personal information and says they can use and share that with third parties for targeted, interest-based "
"advertising. None of this is great. Let’s try this again: we hope that Nintendo will stop collecting and combining information from third parties and that they’ll make ad targeting optional for all "
