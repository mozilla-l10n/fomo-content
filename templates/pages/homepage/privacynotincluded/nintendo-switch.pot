"What would the world be like without Mario, Zelda, and Animal Crossing? Worse, for sure. Whether you play Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch or on the cheaper Switch Lite, you're still going to have "
"good time. And we've always liked that good guy Nintendo puts a lot of emphasis on easy-to-use parental controls and an easy to read <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>. Which is why we're a bit bummed "
"to see Nintendo recently made some changes to their privacy policy that raises some red flags for us. Nintendo has always been pretty good at privacy, so we're feeling a little like getting hit with"

"First off, Nintendo does collect a fair amount of personal information. Things like name, email address, postal address, phone number, date of birth, country of residence, language, gender, device "
"and advertising identifiers and other unique personal or online identifiers, location (with your consent), health information (with your consent), and lots of information about how and when and what"

"Nintendo also says they can “receive information about you from other sources, including from other users of our services, and third-party services and organizations.” This worries us a bit because "
"they say they can take this information they receive from third party sources and combine it with information they have about you and build an even bigger profile on you. And they say they can use "
"that information to do things like offer you customized content, provide you with tailored advertising, and send you promotional materials from them or their affiliates and business partners (which "
"could be a pretty good number of companies). So, Nintendo collects a good deal of personal information and says they can use and share that with third parties for targeted, interest-based "
"advertising. None of this is great."

"Nintendo also says they can aggregate or de-identify the personal information they collect on you and then that new de-identified data is no longer subject to their privacy policy and they can do "
"pretty much whatever they want with it. Which is pretty common, but still can be a bit of a concern as it’s been found to be pretty easy to re-identify some of this data, especially with location "
"data."

"Finally, it seems Nintendo doesn’t specifically say all users, regardless of where they live, have the same rights to access and delete their data, which is what we like to see. Right now they say, "
"“Depending on your place of residence, you may have the right, in accordance with applicable law, to request access to, deletion, and portability of your information.” We believe it’s important for "
"everyone to have the same right to access and delete data, regardless of the data privacy laws they live under. And we believe companies should grant that right, even when they aren’t required to by"
" law. Here’s hoping Nintendo will change their privacy policy to fix this."

"That’s the bad news with Nintendo. Now on to some good news. They do say that they do not, and will not, sell your data. That’s good. Too bad they do share it with third parties for advertising "
