"in your blood. In the era of coronavirus, knowing how much oxygen in your blood is actually a good thing. Apple has a pretty good track record of taking all this very personal data and keeping it "

"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. They don't share or sell your data and Apple takes special care to make sure your Siri requests aren't associated with you. Apple"

"menstrual cycle, hearing, breathing, and your heart's electrical signals. Better hope your insurance company never gets access to all that info cause that could get weird (and costly)."
