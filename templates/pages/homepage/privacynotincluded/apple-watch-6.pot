"The Apple Watch still reigns supreme in the world of smart watches. You've got all your email, text, phone calls, music, podcasts, and more right there on your wrist (as long as you have an iPhone, "
"of course). And it tracks lots of health data. There's heart rate, sleep tracking, steps, calories, blood oxygen levels, ECG, fall detection, and more. Apple has a pretty good track record of taking"
" all this very personal data and keeping it safe, which we appreciate."

"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. They say they don't share your data for their own advertisement purposes and Apple takes special care to make sure your Siri "
"requests aren't associated with you, which is great. Apple did face backlash in 2019 when it came to light their contractors were regularly listening in on confidential personal conversations when "
"they were reviewing the voice assistant's recordings. Apple changed their policy so users weren't automatically opted-in to human voice review. Recently, Apple made another <a id=\"a1\">positive "
"change</a> for your Siri voice requests — many audio requests for things like setting timers or alarms or controlling music will no longer be sent over the internet to their servers, instead "
"processing them directly on the device. This is better for your privacy."

"What is not good is what can happen with all this very personal health data if others aren't careful. A recent <a id=\"a1\">report</a> showed that health data for over 61 million fitness tracker "
"users, including both Fitbit and Apple, was exposed when a third party company that allowed users to sync their health data from their fitness trackers did not secure the data properly. Personal "
"information such as names, birthdates, weight, height, gender, and geographical location for Apple and other fitness tracker users was left exposed because the company didn't password protect or "
"encrypt their database. This is a great reminder that yes, while Apple might do a good job with their own security, anytime you sync or share that data with anyone else, it could be vulnerable. I "

"there on the Cloud. Apple says, \"<br/>When your phone is locked with a passcode, Touch ID or Face ID, all of your health and fitness data in the Health app, other than your Medical ID, is "
