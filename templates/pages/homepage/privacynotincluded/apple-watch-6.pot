"The Apple Watch still reigns supreme in the world of smart watches. You've got all your email, text, phone calls, music, podcasts, and more right there on your wrist (as long as you have an iPhone, "
"of course). And it tracks lots of health data. There's heart rate, sleep tracking, steps, calories, blood oxygen levels, ECG, fall detection, and more. Apple has a pretty good track record of taking"
" all this very personal data and keeping it safe, which we appreciate. But because “and more” can include menstrual cycle tracking, we took an even closer look at the Apple Watch’s privacy and "
"security since Roe vs. Wade was overturned in the US in 2022 -- which allowed states to make access to abortion illegal. Still, Apple held up pretty well overall. They have a <a id=\"a1\">pretty "
"good history</a> of standing up to law enforcement requests for their users' data."

"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. But, like life, hackers find a way! So Apple has had some pretty serious security issues. In 2023, Apple released fixes for <a "
"id=\"a1\">three</a> <a id=\"a2\">different</a> <a id=\"a3\">vulnerabilities</a> that made it possible for bad actors to hack Apple devices. <a id=\"a4\">In 2022</a>, they had a security flaw that "
"could allow hackers to take complete control of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Earlier that year, Apple also <a id=\"a5\">gave up data</a> to hackers who forged emergency data requests from law "
"enforcement. Eesh. Back in 2021, another bad <a id=\"a6\">security vulnerability</a> could have allowed bad actors to record calls and messages and even turn the device camera and microphone on "
"without the user knowing. Eesh. The good thing with Apple and security is, they seem to take these security breaches seriously, jump and fix them immediately, and communicate pretty well with users "
"on what they need to do to stay safe. So keep those devices updated, folks!"

"On the privacy front, this device does track a whole bunch of biometric data including your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, menstrual cycle, hearing, breathing, and your heart's electrical signals."
" That's a lot of personal information gathered in one place. A reminder that sharing a lot of your intimate personal data always carries <a id=\"a1\">some risk</a>. Like when, back <a id=\"a2\">in "
"2021</a>, the health data for over 61 million fitness tracker users, including both Fitbit and Apple, was exposed when a third party company that allowed users to sync their health data from their "
"fitness trackers did not secure the data properly. Personal information such as names, birthdates, weight, height, gender, and geographical location for Apple and other fitness tracker users was "
"left exposed because the company didn't password protect or encrypt their database. This is a great reminder that yes, while Apple might do a good job with their own security, anytime you sync or "
"share that data with anyone else, it could be vulnerable. I don't know about you, but I don't need the world to know my weight and where I live. That’s really dang creepy."

"And given Apple Health data can be synced with lots of third-party apps and companies, well, don't do that. The more you share this data, the more likely it can be that it will be vulnerable. Limit "

"The risk of your health data being exposed is especially concerning if it could be used against you in a court of law, like in some US states where abortion is illegal. But Apple does do a pretty "
"good job with privacy, so that's good when it comes to using the Apple Health app for period and reproductive health tracking. And if users take the steps Apple recommends to protect this data, it "
"should be fairly safe out there on the Cloud. Apple <a id=\"a1\">says</a>, \"When your phone is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all your health and fitness data in the Health app — "
"other than your Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on our servers. And if you use a recent version of watchOS and iOS and turn on two-"
"factor authentication and a passcode, your health and activity data will be backed up in a way that Apple can’t read.\" So lock those phones down, set up two-factor authentication, disable iCloud "
"sharing of Apple Health data, and don't share any of those passcodes with anyone, ever."

"Finally, Apple does have a pretty general statement about how they might share data with law enforcement in their privacy policy, which is kinda a bummer. They say, \"We may also disclose "
"information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\" Fortunately, Apple does"
" have a pretty good track record at pushing back against law enforcement requests for data."

"What’s the worst that could happen? Well, while using an Apple Watch and Apple Health to track your period might be safer than other options, it's good to remember that it's still far from perfect. "
