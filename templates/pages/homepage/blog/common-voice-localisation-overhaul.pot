"Different communities employ different techniques depending on the specific requirements of their projects, the resources available, and the characteristics of the language they are working with. "
"The new localisation approach offers greater flexibility, allowing communities to start data collection earlier with a reduced initial workload. This change accommodates various data collection "
"goals, from small datasets for fine-tuning existing models to larger collections for training new models from scratch. This change aims to make Common Voice more accessible to a wider range of "
"language communities, particularly those with limited resources or smaller speaker populations."
