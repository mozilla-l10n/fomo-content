"The overall goal of AI has been to create technology that allows computers and machines to work intelligently. As we currently understand it, AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in "
"machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. Given the growth we have seen in AI, it was only a matter of time before these (AI) systems began autonomously “inventing” "
"and “creating” works of their own."

"According to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), intellectual property (IP) refers to <i>creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and "
"symbols, names and images used in commerce</i>. IP is protected in law through the awarding of intellectual property rights (IPRs) such as patents, trademarks, and copyright. These rights enable "
"their respective owners to earn recognition and/or financial benefit from what they invent or create."

"Looking at the thresholds that need to be met for copyright protection to accrue, The Next Rembrandt is indeed a work eligible for copyright protection (artistic work), and the piece of art was "
"indeed reduced into a tangible form (it was 3-D printed). However, would the element of the art being autonomously generated by AI satisfy the originality threshold?"

"Looking at another example, in 2021 South Africa granted an  AI system, that produced an invention, patent rights. The application listed an AI system, called DABUS, as the inventor, and the "
"machine’s owner, <a id=\"a1\">Stephen Thaler</a>, as the patent owner. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and The European Patent Office (EPO) both rejected the application on the"
" grounds that their patent laws recognise and require that an inventor be a natural person. It is worth noting, though, that South Africa does not offer formal examination and instead only requires "
"applicants to merely complete a filing for their invention for patent rights to be awarded."

"At the core, the issue of whether AI-generated works can receive IPRs, and whether AI can own, exploit, and enforce legal rights, is the question of whether AI has or can have the legal capacity to "
"create, own, exploit and enforce the rights awarded through IP protection. As it stands, several jurisdictions have resisted giving AI any such legal capacity. Even so, looking at how AI technology "
"continues to grow and considering the example of programmes such as ChatGPT, should this change?"
