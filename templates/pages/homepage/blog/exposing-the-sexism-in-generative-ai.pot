"Algowritten is fueled by the <a id=\"a1\">Stepford app</a>, a clever approach that turns AI technology back on itself. The team specially trains GPT-3 and similar algorithms to spot sexist bias that"

"Courneya notes that one of the most common sexist habits of generative AI is “course correction toward heteronormativity. It keeps nudging you back toward the center.” For example, when the team ran"

"The team is also making the app more opinionated. For example, rather than simply saying “This paragraph is biased,” it might say, “Wow! The man in this story is treating women like objects.” “That "

"What’s next for Algowritten? Jackson says the project could yield an application similar to Grammarly, but for spotting sexism rather than grammatical errors. The team hopes for something more far "
"reaching, however. “We see it as data and a set of methodologies that can be folded back into the technologies themselves,” Jackson says. “This could lay the groundwork for future development.”"

"They also note that their AI, like any AI, has limitations — which is perhaps the overarching lesson of the project. As an example, Heys points to times when a sexist or otherwise pejorative term is"
" reclaimed and used by its intended targets. “It’s very difficult for that to be trained in an AI and kept up to date,” he says. “It’s very difficult to have a neutral broker.”"
