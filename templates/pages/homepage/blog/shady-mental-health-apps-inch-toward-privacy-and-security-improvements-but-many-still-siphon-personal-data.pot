"Researchers, however, did uncover some bright spots. Exposing shady data practices motivated some tech companies to do better: nearly one-third of the apps made some improvements over their 2022 "
"performance. And two apps — PTSD Coach and the AI chatbot Wysa — received a “Best Of” citation, which Mozilla uses to spotlight the apps doing privacy and security right. Over 255 hours of research,"
" including more than eight hours of research per product, went into creating the 2023 mental health app guide."

"Says Jen Caltrider, Mozilla’s *Privacy Not Included Lead: “Our main goal is better protection for consumers, so we were encouraged to see that some apps made changes that amount to a better privacy "
"for the public. And sometimes all that had to be done to make those positive changes was to ask the companies to do better. But the worst offenders are still letting consumers down in scary ways, "
"tracking and sharing their most intimate information and leaving them incredibly vulnerable. The handful of apps that handle data responsibly and respectfully prove that it can be done right.”"
