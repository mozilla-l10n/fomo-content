"Recent revelations from Facebook whistleblower confirm what scholars and technologists have argued for a while: monetization imperatives shape functions and forms of incumbent social networks, which"
" in turn are leading to antidemocratic processes. These range from the amplification of hate and disinformation, to hyperpolarization, to anti-scientific theories that have regained followers and "
"even violence spinning off to the offline world."

"In Latin-America, people spend 3h30 per day on social networks, the highest average across all regions (Global Web Index, 2021). As such, the region is particularly affected by the challenges posed "
"by social media, and has witnessed issues such as rampant misinformation about Venezuelan migrants and refugees, to the rise of technopopulism in Brazil (Giuliano da Empoli, 2019). In the context of"
" Covid-19, research suggests that Latin-Americans were particularly prone to misinformation related to health (e.g. social isolation, vaccine uptake) circulating in platforms (UNESCO, upcoming)."

"Among the online population, social media is nearly omnipresent: ‘95% of the online population uses social websites (Global Web Index, 2021). For better or worse, in most countries it is growing to "
"be the primary source of civic and political information."

"Despite impressive engagement metrics (4.2 billion users in the world in 2021, DataReportal 2021), incumbent social platforms are not designed to support deeper discussion that require nuance and "
"attention (instead of clickbait). On the contrary, their addictive immediacy together with algorithms that optimize user engagement KPIs, have favored the superficial consumption of information. "
"Today, as Richard Seymour (2019) puts it: “to inhabit social media is to be in a state of constant distractedness, a junkie fixation on keeping in touch with it”."

"Recent studies, illustrate the danger of constant distractedness, suggesting that misinformation is often shared because of failure “to think sufficiently about whether or not the content is "
"accurate” (Pennycook, 2021). These dynamics foster a negative impact chain, since the use of social media for news is associated with being ‘politically engaged on social media’, which in turn is "
"associated with being more likely to “share inaccurate claims regarding governmental affairs, science, and natural disasters” (Valenzuela, 2019)."
