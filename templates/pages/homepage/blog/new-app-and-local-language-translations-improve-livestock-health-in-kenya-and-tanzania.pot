"In 2023, LivHealth Kiswahili Corpus <a id=\"a1\">launched a smartphone app</a> for CDRs and pastoralists that helps them record, document, and share information about disease outbreaks. Using the "
"shared reports and data captured through the app, county governments newly responsible for supporting pastoralists have been able to identify disease hotspots more quickly and to start interventions"
" like mass vaccinations sooner to save more animals. The LivHealth team recently translated its digital disease manuals, which help CDRs initially identify illnesses, from English to Kiswahili, "
"further expanding access to the information. Since launching its disease surveillance system, LivHealth has facilitated the vaccination of 3,524,760 goats and sheep, benefitting about 33,000 "
"households in Kenya’s Turkana County. LivHealth’s system has also helped reduce the prevalence of PPR, or “Goat Plague,” from 21 percent to five percent in that same timeframe."
