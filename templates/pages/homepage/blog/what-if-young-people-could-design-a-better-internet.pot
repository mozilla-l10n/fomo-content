"Under Your Internet is an interactive web experience for internet users between the ages of 13 and 17. Teens take a data personality quiz, learn about the current state of data collection online, "
"and are introduced to alternative forms of data governance. Those alternatives — like data co-ops, data trusts, and open commons — are personified as creatures who teens can chat with. The "
"alternatives are based on investigations by Mozilla’s <a id=\"a1\">Data Futures Lab</a> and other researchers."

"underrepresented in decision-making and development. Our goal is to engage and encourage young people to share their opinions — to reorient technology for the care of future generations.”"

"In addition to meeting data alternatives, teens will also be introduced to the Data Monster — a grotesque personification of the internet’s status quo. The towering, tentacled creature represents "
