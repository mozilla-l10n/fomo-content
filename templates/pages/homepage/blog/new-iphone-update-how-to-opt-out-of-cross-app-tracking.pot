"If you use an Apple iPhone, a new software update will give you the option to opt out of tracking by apps (including from Facebook, Instagram, and more) when you use your phone.<br/><br/>This is an "
"important pro-privacy change that Apple announced it would make in 2020 – <a id=\"a1\">after Mozilla supporters called on the company to stop giving advertisers so much access to consumer data</a> "
"by regularly resetting users' IDFA. (Need a refresher on IDFA? <a id=\"a2\">Check out this Mozilla Explains.)</a> And now iPhone users finally can decide if they want to opt-in to "
"tracking.<br/><br/>Until now, advertisers have been able to track the actions users take across activity on iPhone – kind of like a salesperson that follows you from store to store while you shop, "
"recording every item you look at. Creepy, right?"
