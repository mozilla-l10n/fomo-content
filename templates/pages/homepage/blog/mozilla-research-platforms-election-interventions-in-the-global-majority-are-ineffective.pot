"<b>(NAIROBI, KENYA | FEBRUARY 27, 2024) —</b> Amid a historic number of elections across the globe in 2024, online platforms' inadequate policies in the Global South are weighing heavily on fragile "
"democracies, according to a series of election-related research published today by Mozilla’s Open Source Research and Investigations team."

"Additionally, Mozilla is publishing a “Global Elections Casebook,” featuring <a id=\"a1\">three case studies</a> on elections in <a id=\"a2\"><b>India (2019)</b></a><b>,</b> <a id=\"a3\"><b>Brazil "
"(2022)</b></a>, and <a id=\"a4\"><b>Liberia (2023)</b></a>, exploring platforms’ struggle in developing meaningful policies and interventions around elections with complex information environments, "
"languages, and cultural contexts. A common thread drawn from these case studies is that platforms are consistently underprepared and under-resource initiatives to safeguard elections across the "
"Global Majority. Moreover, messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram play a crucial role in supercharging election misinformation yet the platform’s operation is met by limited oversight. The "
"casebook will be expanded to include other countries’ elections over the coming year."

"Madung’s report vividly illustrates platforms' unequal strategies when it comes to election-related policies. The research reviews over 200 platform commitment announcements from 2016 - 2023 and "
"across 27 countries — and finds that the lion’s share of these interventions were exclusively in the U.S. or Europe. These interventions account for at least 62% of the total 197 geography-specific "
"interventions. For the study, Madung analyzed policies ranging from advertising bans and moratoriums, fact-checking partnerships, digital literacy programs, to content moderation commitments."

"According to the report, the top three election intervention platforms announced were 1) digital literacy programs <b>(23 countries)</b>, 2) fact-checking initiatives <b>(21 countries)</b>, and 3) "
"content moderation policy updates <b>(21 countries).</b> While the interventions in the U.S. and Europe focused mainly on political advertising, policies across the Global Majority have been aimed "
"at content moderation strategies, which have been rocked by <a id=\"a1\">massive layoffs</a> of trust and safety teams and <a id=\"a2\">poor working conditions</a> for content moderators. Madung "
"observed that the majority of the public-facing announcements about content moderation interventions were published by Meta, followed closely by TikTok."

"<b>Says Odanga Madung:</b> “It's a glaring travesty that platforms blatantly favor the U.S. and Europe with excessive policy coddling and protections, while systematically neglecting the electoral "

"<b>Ineffective one-size-fits-all template approach:</b> Madung observed that election-related interventions in Kenya, Nigeria, and Ethiopia had deep similarities, as though copied from a template, "
"despite each of these African countries having unique socio-political contexts. Devastatingly this practice appears to be common. <a id=\"a1\">Brazilian researchers</a> also noted a careless “copy-"
"paste” approach between the TikTok policies announced in the U.S. and those in Brazil, ahead of the 2022 Brazilian elections. The copied translation policy was so shoddy, to the extent that it "
"included mail-in voting, which does not exist in Brazil. Platforms’ sloppiness in rolling out effective policies marks the pinnacle of disregard for democracy in Global Majority countries, the "
"report notes."

"<b>Political disarray and WhatsApp:</b> WhatsApp has a large user base in countries like Nigeria, Brazil, India, and elsewhere across the Global Majority, where billions of people rely on the "
"platform to communicate. Despite WhatsApp’s crucial role in the information ecosystem, Meta has not updated its policies to reflect the exponential growth of the app from a private messaging tool to"
" <a id=\"a1\">broadcasting tool</a> similar to a public social network. The report reveals the ease with which propaganda and other forms of disinformation can be distributed via WhatsApp. In the "
"India case study of the 2019 elections, researcher Divij Joshi notes that political parties purchased voters' personal information from data brokers and created Whatsapp groups based on “audience "
"segments” to actively target these groups with the most appealing messaging. “Electoral propaganda has become professionalized,” Joshi argues. In the Brazilian context of the 2022 elections, "
"researchers Lorena Regattieri and Débora Salles echo WhatsApp and Telegram’s role in snowballing disinformation, conspiracy theories and amplifying junk news sources."

"<b>Fact-checking initiatives do not always match local contexts.</b><br/>Election interventions in Global Majority countries tend to be limited in non-English speaking contexts, significantly "
"affecting fact-checking initiatives. This was particularly damaging in the Liberian 2023 elections as noted by case book researchers Eric Mugendi and Rabiu Alhassan. Researchers argue that Meta’s "
"reliance on fact-checkers outside the country missed the mark on providing local insights, impacting the quality of election-related information on the platform."
