"(July 7, 2021) -- YouTube’s controversial algorithm is recommending videos considered disturbing and hateful that often violate the platform’s very own content policies, according to a 10-month "
"long, crowdsourced investigation <a id=\"a1\">released today</a> by Mozilla. The in-depth study also found that people in non-English speaking countries are far more likely to encounter videos they "

"“YouTube needs to admit their algorithm is designed in a way that harms and misinforms people,” says Brandi Geurkink, Mozilla’s Senior Manager of Advocacy. “Our research confirms that YouTube not "
"only hosts, but actively recommends videos that violate its very own policies. We also now know that people in non-English speaking countries are the most likely to bear the brunt of YouTube’s out-"
"of-control recommendation algorithm.”"

"Data collected through the study paints a vivid picture of how YouTube’s algorithm amplifies harmful, debunked, and inappropriate content: One person watched videos about the U.S. military, and was "
"then recommended a misogynistic video titled “Man humilitates feminist in viral video.” Another person watched a video about software rights, and was then recommended a video about gun rights. And a"

"While the research uncovered numerous examples of hate speech, debunked political and scientific misinformation, and other categories of content that would likely violate YouTube’s Community "
"Guidelines, it also uncovered many examples that paint a more complicated picture of online harm. Many of the videos reported may fall into the category of what YouTube calls “borderline "
"content”—videos that “skirt the borders” of their Community Guidelines without actually violating them."

"<b><i>On methodology:</i></b> <i>Mozilla used rigorous quantitative and qualitative methods when conducting this research. Statistical methods entailed calculation of counts, proportions, and rates,"
" while slicing by relevant variables. All differences described in this report were statistically significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level, and all statistical significance was evaluated at this level. "
"Mozilla also convened a working group of experts with backgrounds in online harms, freedom of expression, and tech policy to watch a sample of the reported videos, and then develop a conceptual "
"framework for classifying them based on YouTube’s Community Guidelines. A team of 41 research assistants employed by the University of Exeter then used this conceptual framework to assess the "
