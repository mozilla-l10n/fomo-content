"Platforms like YouTube and Facebook use algorithms to decide what kind of videos and stories you’re most likely to enjoy based on past content you’ve watched or engaged with. Sometimes this can be "
"harmless, like if Facebook decides you’re more likely to ❤️ a cat photo than a dog one. Sometimes it can even be useful, like if YouTube recommends a cooking video it (correctly) thinks you’ll like."

"But sometimes, algorithms can trap people in an echochamber where their beliefs are never challenged. Though<a id=\"a1\"> YouTube denies it,</a> research shows that content recommendation algorithms"

" that lets you experience other people’s YouTube bubbles. “So if you're skeptical about climate change, YouTube can recommend even more content denying climate change — confirming the bias that you "
