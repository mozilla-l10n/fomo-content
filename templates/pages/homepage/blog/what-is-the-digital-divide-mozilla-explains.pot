"No, it isn’t not a new kind of math equation! The digital divide is the gap that exists between people in the world who have access to computers, mobile devices and the internet, and those who do "
"not. As we outlined in our Internet Health Report, <a id=\"a1\">nearly half of the world is still offline</a>, meaning half of the world is still unable to benefit from the digital age and the "
"digital economy."

"The digital divide exists everywhere you look. In the United States, there are millions of Americans <a id=\"a1\">without reliable internet access in their homes</a>, but the differences in "

"Even for those who are online, disparities still exist. For example, police brutality at a protest in a location with reliable internet access, like the US or Hong Kong, will likely be far better "
