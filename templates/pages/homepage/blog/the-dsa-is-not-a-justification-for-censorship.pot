"Mozilla and 66 civil society organisations call on the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, to clarify comments he made in response to the protests in France. Commissioner "

"We also urge the Commission to ensure that the national implementation of the DSA respect’s the regulation’s objectives and upholds fundamental rights. The French draft law to secure and regulate "
"digital space (Projet de loi “Sécuriser et réguler l'espace numérique”, <a id=\"a1\">SREN</a>), which is supposed to implement the DSA and other European legislation to the national level, risks "
"doing the opposite. The bill currently includes a clause that would force browsers to create a tool for the French government to choose which websites to block. This would undermine the objectives "
"of the DSA, as well as net neutrality and internet health worldwide."

"early on, since such a move would overturn decades of established norms and provide a playbook for authoritarian governments."
