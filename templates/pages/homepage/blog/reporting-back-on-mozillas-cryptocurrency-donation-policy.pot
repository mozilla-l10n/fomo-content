"At the start of 2022, Mozilla found ourselves in the middle of a heated discussion about cryptocurrency. Mozilla, a nonprofit, had been accepting cryptocurrency donations since 2014. But we hadn’t "
"reassessed that decision since Mozilla published its <a id=\"a1\">climate commitments</a> — and since cryptocurrency’s environmental toll <a id=\"a2\">has become more apparent</a>."

"In January, following feedback from staff and supporters, we decided to <a id=\"a1\">pause</a> the ability to donate cryptocurrency and announced we would conduct a review. We wanted to increase our"

"These decisions are informed by our <a id=\"a1\">climate commitments</a>. In January 2021 Mozilla pledged to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas footprint year over year, aiming to exceed the "
"net zero emissions commitment of the Paris Climate Agreement. The first update to our donation policy targets that commitment: <a id=\"a2\">Proof-of-work</a> cryptocurrencies can significantly "
"increase our GHG footprint due to their energy intensive nature. Mozilla’s decision not to accept proof-of-work donations ensures that our fundraising activities remain aligned with our emissions "
"commitment."

"In our climate commitments, we also promised to help develop, design, and improve products from a sustainability perspective. We believe that Mozilla can play a positive role in the industry by "
