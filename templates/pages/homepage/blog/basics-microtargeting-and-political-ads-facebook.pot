"While there has been a lot of news recently about microtargeting – in particular when it comes to political ads – many people are still unfamiliar with how microtargeting works. Advertisers like "

"Microtargeting might help you discover your new favorite shampoo, but when it comes to political advertising, it can be especially problematic as it contributes to the spread of misinformation and "
"digital manipulation – essentially jeopardizing the democratic process. There are lots of ways that this happens. Sometimes, an electoral campaign may run an official ad that’s problematic. More "
"often, outside groups may run misinformation campaigns using microtargeting to polarize people and influence elections."

"Facebook <a id=\"a1\">defines political ads</a> as those that are about, paid for by, or on behalf of a candidate for public office, or that otherwise advocate for a specific electoral outcome. "
"That’s fairly straightforward, but Facebook also extends its definition to ads about social issues as well as those that are generally about a referendum or encourage general voter participation."

"So how does microtargeting on Facebook work? Targeted ads use data to segment audiences into different categories: demographic, geographic, income, and endless others. This data may be either "
"collected directly, bought from another party, or inferred about an individual. Microtargeting combines different sets of personal data to segment and target users in increasingly invasive ways."

"There are many ways that audiences can be segmented and targeted via Facebook’s ad platform. Microtargeting allows advertisers to more precisely tailor their messages to specific audience segments –"

"<b>Custom audiences</b> allow advertisers to upload their lists and create a specific audience they want to reach (or exclude). On Facebook, custom audiences can include people identified through "
"web traffic via a pixel embedded on websites outside of Facebook. This means that even when you’re browsing another website, that information could end up back at Facebook. It also means that any "
"company or organization that has your email address can find you and target you with ads on Facebook. For political campaigns, they can also upload the voter file they have purchased and match other"
" information they have about you to your voting history. <a id=\"a1\">In January, Facebook announced that it will allow users to control which ads they see based on custom audience targeting</a>."

"<b>Look-alike audiences</b> is a Facebook tool that allows advertisers to upload a list or select a custom audience of people and then, using a complex algorithm, create an audience that is likely "
"to be just as receptive to the messaging as the initial custom audience. For instance, an advertiser may choose a custom audience (“people who like the Beach Boys”) and then use Facebook’s look-"
