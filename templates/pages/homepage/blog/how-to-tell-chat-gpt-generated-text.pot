"The AI wars are heating up. In late 2022, Open AI’s <a id=\"a1\">Chat GPT</a> made headlines for showing us what a new search engine could look like. ChatGPT (which stands for “Generative Pre-"
"trained Transformer”) is a chatbot — one that can process queries and spit out relevant information to answer questions about historical facts, recipes, car dimensions and lots more. As a bonus, "
"ChatGPT lets you word questions in plain English, so you’re not forced to write queries like “how to stop dog pooping everywhere reddit.” The result is, essentially, a search box that you can "
"message back and forth with. It almost makes Google search look a little primitive. Microsoft, the maker of Bing and biggest investor in Open AI, is <a id=\"a2\">okay with this</a>."

"You can detect Chat GPT-written text using online tools like <a id=\"a1\">OpenAI API Key</a>. The tool comes from Open AI, itself, the company that made Chat GPT. It’s worth noting that the app "
"isn’t perfect. Open AI says the tool needs at least 1,000 words before it can sniff out AI-generated content, so something like an AI-generated text message may fly under its radar. Also, even if it"
" gets the 1,000 words it needs, it isn’t always 100% accurate at detecting AI vs human written language. AI-made text that has been edited by a human can also fool the tool."

"It’s important to emphasize that no method of detecting AI-written text is foolproof — that includes options using tools available today. Jesse McCrosky is a data scientist with Mozilla Foundation "
"who warns of AI text detection tools’ limitations. “Detector tools will always be imperfect, which makes them nearly useless for most applications,” say McCrosky. “One can not accuse a student of "
"using AI to write their essay based on the output of a detector tool that you know has a 10% chance of giving a false positive.”"

"According to McCrosky, it can be impossible to ever have a true AI-detector because it will always be possible for software to write “undetectable” texts or create text with the specific intent of "
"evading these sorts of detectors. And then there’s the fact that the AI tools available to us are always improving. “There can be some sense of an ‘arms race’ between Chat GPT text detectors and "
"detector-evaders, but there will never be a situation in which detectors can be trusted,” says McCrosky."

"It’s no secret that ChatGPT can (<a id=\"a1\">and has</a>) been spreading misinformation and disinformation. Microsoft may be <a id=\"a2\">using</a> tools like those from NewsGuard to limit the "
"misleading responses its AI gives, but the issue is still cause for concern. <a id=\"a3\">The Poynter Institute</a> has our favorite tips to spot misinformation within Chat GPT: 1) check for "
"patterns and inconsistencies, 2) look for signs of human error and check the context. If a ChatGPT answer repeats something multiple times, has weird errors that a person wouldn’t make or says "
"something that doesn’t make sense in the context of what you’re reading, you might be reading misleading content. Check the source links at the bottom of your Chat GPT responses and make sure you do"
