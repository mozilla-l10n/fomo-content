"<b>(Mexico City, Mexico | June 2, 2022) —</b> Digital spaces expected to be avenues of freedom of expression are actually being used to monitor, target, and harass journalists, activists, and other "
"members of civil society bodies, a recently published anthology shows."

"The e-book — originally published in Spanish as <i>Violencia digital en México: El Estado vs. La sociedad civil</i> and now available in English — illustrates how digital tools are heightening "
"surveillance and attacks directed at individuals, vulnerable communities, and groups appearing to question the political status quo in Mexico."

"Argüelles’ chapter, “Technolosolutionism as Obstruction of Justice,” cautions against the overreliance on technology to solve structural societal challenges. Especially challenges like violence "

"This anthology shows the extent to which techno-solutionism tends to validate the use of abusive technology. A state that assumes the people it governs are potential criminals is a state that relies"

"Mexico is ranked as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in Latin America. This treatment enables a silencing chamber that leaves countless residents in the dark, uninformed or "
"misinformed. “Legitimate use of force” through technology directly breaches fundamental rights such as privacy, freedom of expression, or the right to information."
