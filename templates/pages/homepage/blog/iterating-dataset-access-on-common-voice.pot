"<b>What is a delta release?</b> Let’s imagine you had downloaded Common Voice 10 for Catalan, a total download size of 49 GB, now Common Voice 11 is released and you want to get all that amazing new"
" data. A delta release allows you to download <b>only the new data</b>, that is the difference between the Common Voice 10 release and the 11 release."

"<b>Why are you doing this?</b> We have had a lot of feedback from the community that the large download sizes were a problem for many users and developers wanting to use the dataset. The download "
"size can take a long time for people on slow connections and downloading a large amount of data can be difficult on unstable connections too. For many of our community, being forced to download "
"clips that they already have from the previous release has been costly and wasteful."

"<b>Will you be offering deltas between all the releases?</b> We will be offering delta releases between the last release and the latest release on a rolling basis. So at some point after the next "
"release (Common Voice 11 in October) we will make available the delta between <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. At the release following that (Common Voice 12) we will make available the delta between "
"<b>11</b> and <b>12,</b> and so on."

"<b>Will it be split in the same way?</b> The delta releases will not be split. Depending on your use case, you can choose to add all the data to your training set, or you can merge with the previous"
" version and use CorporaCreator to create a version that will be identical to the full Common Voice 11 release."
