"Researchers found major discrepancies between safety features on TikTok Lite and the flagship TikTok app, several of which contradict the platforms’ very own policies. According to the researchers, "
"multiple of these safety guardrails are easy to integrate into TikTok Lite without increasing the app’s size.<br/><br/> The research — titled “<a id=\"a1\"><b>Light on Safety: How TikTok Lite "
"Sacrifices User Protections in the Global Majority</b></a>” — reveals how TikTok Lite lacks crucial user protections across two categories:"

"TikTok Lite is currently unavailable in the U.S. and the majority of Europe. It operates as a mini version of the flagship app, consuming less internet data, storage, and phone battery use while "
"remaining functional in poor connectivity environments. The research findings reinforce a <a id=\"a1\">recent Mozilla report</a> that found platforms disproportionately deploy fewer policies in "
"Global Majority regions."

"Research methodology entailed analysis of community guideline policies, settings, and other features across both versions of TikTok. Researchers evaluated nine features categorized under “labeling "
"measures” and “user control functions.” Under labeling measures, they scrutinized how well the platforms flagged misinformation, dangerous acts, graphic content, and synthetic content. On the user "
"control functions, they studied screen time management, content preference settings, comment filtering, reporting and blocking, and child restrictions."

"<b>TikTok Lite has a safety problem.</b> TikTok’s policy on <a id=\"a1\">Dangerous Acts and Activity</a> is clear: “We do not allow showing or promoting dangerous activity and challenges.” In cases "
"where potentially dangerous undertakings are depicted, TikTok includes a warning banner that illustrates that the activity is done by a professional or in the company of professional guidelines. "
"While these labels exist in the mainstream app, they are not present on the Lite version."

"Similarly, banners used to warn users about graphic or disturbing content are also not available on the TikTok Lite version. Sensitive explicit content can easily go unflagged, reaching millions of "
