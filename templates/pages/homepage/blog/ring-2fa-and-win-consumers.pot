"Today, Amazon <a id=\"a1\">announced</a> that two-factor authentication (2FA) is now mandatory for all Ring users. In recent months, several stories have emerged about Ring users being hacked, "
"harassed, and spied on. This extra layer of security will help prevent further episodes."

"<b>This is positive news for consumers — and proves that even the mightiest tech companies will respond to consumer pressure.</b> We often feel helpless about the state of online privacy and "
"security. But when a movement of consumers, nonprofits, and journalists reaches critical mass, we can push consumer tech in a better direction."

"The change comes on the heels of loud advocacy by Ring users and organizations like Mozilla and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). In December, Mozilla <a id=\"a1\">launched</a> a petition urging"
" Amazon to mandate 2FA for all Ring devices, and over 8,000 consumers signed on. Meanwhile, EFF <a id=\"a2\">revealed</a> that Ring shares personal data with an array of third parties. (In today’s "
"announcement, Ring also said it is pausing certain third-party tracking and allowing users to opt out of targeted ads.)"

"There’s a lot of work ahead of us — both in the industry at large, and with Ring specifically. For example, extensive reporting has highlighted concerns about Ring’s <a id=\"a1\">ongoing "
"partnerships</a> with police departments across the U.S., and the way in which its Neighbors app can stoke fear, paranoia, and over-policing. But today, we’re applauding Amazon and Ring for "
"listening to consumers and prioritizing its customers’ security."
