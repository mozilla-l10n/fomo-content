"There are various ways that OpenAI might attempt to enforce their policies. Firstly, they can use <a id=\"a1\">reinforcement learning to train the system not to engage in unwanted behavior</a>. "
"Similarly a “system prompt” can be <a id=\"a2\">used to tell the model what sorts of requests should be refused</a>. The ease with which I was able to generate the material – no special prompting "
"tricks needed – suggests that these approaches have not been applied to the campaign material policy. It’s also possible that there is some monitoring of potentially violative use that is then "
