"Have you ever used YouTube and then, at the end of a video, the app suggested a follow-up video that’s way off base? If so, you’re not alone. We asked YouTube users to tell us whenever they watched "
"a video on the platform and ended up regretting it. According to our <a id=\"a1\">research</a>, 71% of those regrettable views were of videos recommended by YouTube’s algorithm."

"If you’ve ever regretted clicking on a recommendation that YouTube served you, you’re not alone — our <a id=\"a1\">Regrets Reporter</a> campaign is filled with stories from folks just like you. You "
"might not be able to turn off YouTube recommendations, but you might be able to better tailor them to your liking. “Many people like that they receive recommendations from YouTube, the problem is "
"when they’re suggested a video that they don’t want to see,” says Brandi Geurkink, senior manager for advocacy at Mozilla Foundation and <a id=\"a2\">YouTube Regrets</a> lead. “YouTube doesn’t make "
"it easy to find info about how to change your recommendations, but it does let you hand-pick which videos and searches should affect your recommendations.” Geurkink provides a pro-tip: Head to "
"YouTube’s <a id=\"a3\">data management page</a>, and click ‘X’ next to a search to remove it from your history and prevent it from affecting your suggestions."

"We’d add a more drastic option: if your recommendations have become absolutely too much, you can <a id=\"a1\">delete your search history</a> by clicking on your profile icon in the top right of the "
"mobile app, clicking the “Settings” gear icon, tapping “History &amp; privacy” and then “Clear search history.” Deleting your <a id=\"a2\">YouTube watch history</a> in the same settings panel would "
"also help. This serves as a 'hard reset' on your recommendations, pulling you out of the rabbit hole if you’re in too deep. Just know that as soon as you start watching videos again, YouTube will be"
" watching you, and feeding your views into your new recommendation list."

"YouTube’s mobile app has a feature that reminds you to take a break every so often (<a id=\"a1\">found</a> in Settings &gt; General). Though if YouTube’s take a break limiters aren’t to your liking,"
" many smartphone’s offer a similar feature nowadays too. Both <a id=\"a2\">iOS</a> and <a id=\"a3\">Android</a> have options to limit how much of an app you’re allowed to use. Essentially, your "
