"<a id=\"a1\">Collaborative filtering</a>: this is the same sort of machine learning that Netflix uses to suggest another movie and Amazon uses to prompt you with a product you should buy. This sort "
"of filtering is also used in apps like Tinder. The decisions of current Tinder users can affect the options seen by future Tinder users. Put another way, if Tinder sees that you and another user "
"swipe similarly on one option, Tinder assumes that you both may swipe similarly on future options too. This can affect what dating profiles you’re suggested. Nothing depicts this quite like the "
"online game <a id=\"a2\">Monster Match</a> (a previous Mozilla Foundation Creative Media Award winner!) which showcases how your options on apps that use collaborative filtering can become narrow."
