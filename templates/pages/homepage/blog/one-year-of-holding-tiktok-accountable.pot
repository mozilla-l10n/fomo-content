"Pornhub, YouTube, and Facebook. And when Tracking Exposed first decided to research TikTok via TikTok Observatory, their aim was to look into this shadow banning, especially with regard to political"

"Why TikTok? Other than it being the new kid on the block, Fadddoul says TikTok is under-researched — and that the platform works to keep it that way. On platforms like YouTube and Facebook, for "
"example, an Application Programming Interface (API) allows researchers to mine platform activity data, even though it is limited. TikTok does not allow this."

"And so researching shadow banning was not simple. TikTok’s recommender system, a key part of the investigation, is highly personalized and dependent on location, time, and other variables — which "
"made finding patterns difficult. Faddoul says they needed to design a clever way to control the experiment using many different accounts."

"“The first report was basically exposing the fact that TikTok had blocked international content for all its users in Russia, which was quite a dramatic move at the time,” Faddoul says. “TikTok — "
"especially at the beginning of the war — was one of the few places where there was vocal dissent against the Kremlin in Russia, and where information was still flowing rather freely.”"

"<a id=\"a1\">According to the report,</a> “TikTok had announced that it would not allow new content uploads in response to the Russian law that made spreading ‘fake news’ about the Russian army a "
"crime punishable by 15 years in prison, but TikTok did not announce that it has banned all foreign accounts for users in Russia.”"

"“It turned out that before the ban, the majority of the content was against the war and supporting the Ukrainian side in Russia,” Faddoul says. “However after the ban, only pro-Kremlin content would"
" go through. And so we saw how this ban not only limited the ability for dissidents to voice their concerns or their perspective on TikTok, but also enabled propaganda to continue.”"

"“This was something unprecedented which we called ‘shadow promotion’ as opposed to shadow banning,” Faddoul explains. “Here was the opposite. You had content that appeared to be banned on the "
"platform if you accessed it directly, but in fact it was still being promoted by the recommendation system.”"
