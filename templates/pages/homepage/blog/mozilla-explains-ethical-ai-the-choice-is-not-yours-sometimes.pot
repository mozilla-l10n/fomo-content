"By now you know <a id=\"a1\">what AI is</a>. Not just that it stands for artificial intelligence but that it takes in information and uses it to make predictions and decisions. AI powers the social "
"media feed that suggests the next post, it informs the commercials that show up on your streaming service, it drives the software that just auto-completed this sentence. In more serious situations "
"it can determine if you qualify for bail or a home loan. This means that AI-enabled systems both make decisions about you and also make decisions for you. The effects of this can be dire — "
"unethical, even."

"All around us, you can find AI making choices for us. But it isn’t simply a computer acting on its own. AI is designed by us, humans, and that has a huge impact on everything AI does. It’s us humans"
" that tell the computer what to consider and how highly it should rank certain data points. The expectation with AI was that a computer would come to a conclusion using objective information and "
"some fancy coding. The reality is that AI is <a id=\"a1\">just as unfair</a> as the creators that trained it."

"Here are some examples. Take <a id=\"a1\">credit scores</a> — algorithms trained in a biased way may calculate a lower score for a woman compared to a man, which could in turn affect what credit "
"cards they could open or mortgages they could apply for. Another example is <a id=\"a2\">job hiring</a> — recruiters who rely too heavily on software may inadvertently reinforce race and gender-"
"related blindspots. There’s even <a id=\"a3\">car insurance pricing</a> — when opaque algorithms determine who should pay less or more for similar coverage, it offers the opportunity for unfair "
"pricing."
