"According to Mozilla research, popular global brands — including <b>BMW</b>, <b>Ford</b>, <b>Toyota</b>, <b>Tesla</b>, <b>Kia</b>, and <b>Subaru</b> — can collect deeply personal data such as sexual"
" activity, immigration status, race, facial expressions, weight, health and genetic information, and where you drive. Researchers found data is being gathered by sensors, microphones, cameras, and "
"the phones and devices drivers connect to their cars, as well as by car apps, company websites, dealerships, and <a id=\"a1\">vehicle telematics</a>. Brands can then share or sell this data to third"
" parties. Car brands can also take much of this data and use it to develop inferences about a driver’s intelligence, abilities, characteristics, preferences, and more."

"The very worst offender is <b>Nissan</b>. The Japanese car manufacturer admits in their privacy policy to collecting a wide range of information, including sexual activity, health diagnosis data, "

"Other top offenders include <b>Volkswagen</b>, which collects demographic data (like age and gender) and driving behaviors (like your seatbelt and braking habits) for targeted marketing purposes; "
"<b>Toyota</b>, which features a near-incomprehensible galaxy of 12 privacy policy documents; <b>Kia</b>, whose privacy policy states they can collect information about your “sex life;” and "
"<b>Mercedes-Benz</b>, which manufactures certain models with TikTok (an app with its own privacy issues) pre-installed. Analysts <a id=\"a1\">estimate</a> that by 2030, car data monetization could "

"<b>Apps add a new level of complexity (and creepiness).</b> These days, few products come without an associated app — and autos are no exception. Today’s cars have apps that can be handy, helping "
"you find your ride in a crowded parking lot or start your car remotely. But these apps are also an avenue for collecting even more personal data, like location and biometric information. Further, "
"the governance of these apps can be convoluted: <b>BMW</b> USA, for example, manages an app for <b>Toyota</b>."

"<b>Many car brands engage in “privacy washing.”</b> Privacy washing is the act of pretending to protect consumers’ privacy while not actually doing so — and many brands are guilty of this. For "
"example, several have signed on to the automotive <a id=\"a1\">Consumer Privacy Protection Principles</a>. But these principles are nonbinding and <i>created by the automakers themselves</i>. "
"Further, signatories don't even follow their own principles, like Data Minimization (i.e. collecting only the data that is needed)."

"<b>Meaningful consent is nonexistent.</b> Often, “consent” to collect personal data is presumed by simply being a passenger in the car. For example, <b>Subaru</b> states that by being a passenger, "
"you are considered a user — and by being a user, you have consented to their privacy policy. Several car brands also note that it is a driver’s responsibility to tell passengers about the vehicle's "
"privacy policies."

"<b>Autos’ privacy policies and processes are especially bad.</b> Legible privacy policies are uncommon, but they’re exceptionally rare in the automotive industry. Brands like <b>Audi</b> and "
"<b>Tesla</b> feature policies that are confusing, lengthy, and vague. Some brands have more than five different privacy policy documents, an unreasonable number for consumers to engage with; "
"<b>Toyota</b> has 12. Meanwhile, it’s difficult to find a contact with whom to discuss privacy concerns. Indeed, 12 companies representing 20 car brands didn’t even respond to emails from Mozilla "
"researchers."
