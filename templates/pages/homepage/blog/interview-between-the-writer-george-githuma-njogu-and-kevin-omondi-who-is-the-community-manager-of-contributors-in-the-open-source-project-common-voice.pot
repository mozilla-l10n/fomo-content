"I found out about the Common Voice project in 2019 through my PhD degree administrator Dr. Tom Denton from Google. We discussed a lot about how machines can be trained to work as human beings and "
"that is how Common Voice emerged. The focus of the discussion was to develop a sound recognition engine and make it an open source."

"I will call them positive challenges, and these include spending more time away from my daily activities to sustain contributions to the Common Voice platform. Communities sometimes shrink as "

"This project has three phases. The first phase takes place on the Pontoon page. The main function of this page is to receive donations that help translate the Common Voice Kiswahili website, 86% of "
