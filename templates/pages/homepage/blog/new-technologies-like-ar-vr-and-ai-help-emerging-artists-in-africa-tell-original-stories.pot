"There are several barriers to creating tech-driven art in Africa, including a lack of sustainable funding; specific skills gaps on the local level; an inadequate supply of VR/AR headsets, other "
"necessary hardware and training; and uneven access to stable electricity and high-speed internet. The rise of AI in art and storytelling is also presenting both new challenges and possibilities for "
"creatives to navigate."

"<a id=\"a1\">Electric South</a> is dedicated to helping emerging artists create and distribute their work by training them in newer technologies like VR and AR. “Many of the artists we work with "
"have told us how meaningful this is for them, because they can help build the tech and are not just inheriting it fully formed,” said co-director Ingrid Kopp. Some of the challenges the Electric "
"South team have encountered have transformed into opportunities. For instance, exhibitions can be challenging because of limited access to VR headsets for audiences. So the team devised alternative "
"distribution strategies that don’t rely on in-home headsets or large-scale mobilization."

"Electric South is among the first awardees of Mozilla’s <a id=\"a1\">“In Real Life” (IRL) Fund</a>. The fund supports community-serving organizations in Africa advancing digital and human rights, "
"both on and offline — with a particular focus on Eastern and Southern Africa. This grantmaking mechanism is part of the <a id=\"a2\">Africa Innovation Mradi</a>, which leverages Mozilla’s role as "
"stewards of the open web to promote innovation grounded in users’ unique needs across African countries."

"Mozilla’s funding has allowed Electric South to focus on AI’s growing influence on immersive storytelling. The organization has added programming — residential workshops, labs, and online talks — "
"tackling questions around what AI means for artists in terms of both threats and opportunities, how AI works in informal economies, how deepfakes affect the work of documentary and nonfiction "
"storytellers, and more."
