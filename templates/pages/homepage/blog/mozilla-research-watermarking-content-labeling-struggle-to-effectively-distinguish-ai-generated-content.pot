"The lack of effective guardrails is especially urgent as more than half of the world's population prepares to vote in elections this year, including in the U.S., India, Russia, South Africa, and "

"companies like Meta have proposed <a id=\"a2\">industry-wide efforts</a> to label AI-generated content, it’s crucial that open standards are created with the participation of all stakeholders, "
"especially those potentially affected. Further, a coalition of powerful players such as Meta, Google, and Adobe should not become gatekeepers of content integrity.”"
