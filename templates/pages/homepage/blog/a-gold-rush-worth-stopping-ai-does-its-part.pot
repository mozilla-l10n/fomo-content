"For weeks this gnawed at me. The Hutukara activists estimated 20,000 miners were active in the territory. The miners slash the rainforest, pump water through the underlying soils to release the "
"minerals, and mix in mercury to clot with the gold. In Yanomami territory it’s strictly illegal, with no planning, no oversight. The miners churn verdant rainforest and its winding rivers into toxic"
