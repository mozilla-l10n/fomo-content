"Mozilla’s open-source voice dataset, <a id=\"a1\">Common Voice</a>, is diversifying language use in tech by prioritizing local and low resourced languages. By inviting individuals to donate their "
"voices, communities have a hand in making voice-enabled applications more inclusive and accessible in local languages and variants. But to participate at present, Common Voice requires a strong and "
"stable internet connection, which is a limiting factor. The major contribution components of the platform are the sentence collector and the speak and listen interfaces — which allow users to donate"
" their voice and have their clips validated."

"To ensure everyone can easily participate in this initiative, Common Voice <a id=\"a1\">invited</a> voice technology enthusiasts last October to provide solutions that would enable users to donate "

"Says EM Lewis-Jong, Common Voice Lead, “By having an organization like NVIDIA - who actually uses Common Voice to build exciting products - invest back into the project, we have been able to advance"
" the platform, address real inclusion issues and ensure that benefit flows back to the open source community. These two winning projects are just the beginning.”"

"“Spoken voice is the foundation of communication and building speech-based interfaces is one of the most complex machine learning challenges. At NVIDIA, we’re developing groundbreaking research and "

"Two teams, one in Ethiopia and the other in Italy, have each been awarded USD $5000, to execute or advance their ideas.<br/><br/>EM continues, “Common Voice is a platform powered by the people and "
"for the people. This open call was to allow communities to innovatively design solutions that will further the accessibility of voice technology. The two winning projects met all our criteria, from "
"accessibility to open-source design, to privacy, and beyond.”<br/><br/> Below, in their own words, the two teams talk about their projects, motivation to participate, and the impact they intend to "

"Our idea was motivated by a previous project that used a Telegram bot to interact with users and provide basic services in low internet connectivity conditions. Telegram is widely used in Ethiopia "
"so we wanted to tap into the existing user base. We hope that this project motivates and enables Ethiopians to donate their voice in the various spoken languages. We also hope that the project "
"inspires other developers and tech enthusiasts to contribute and use Common Voice’s data set to design voice interaction models for African languages. We believe this will make technology more "
"accessible, contribute to de-biasing AI, and overall reduce the technology gap."
