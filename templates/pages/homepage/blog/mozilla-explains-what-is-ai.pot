"When you hear artificial intelligence (or AI) you probably assume it’s something difficult to understand and above your comprehension level. But, ultimately, AI is software that’s able to recognize "
"patterns. Apps, and other tech products powered by AI, are able to make educated guesses about things it has never encountered using the data it was trained on. Here’s an example: say a data "
"scientist teaches an app to tell the difference between dog photos and cat photos. She uses 1,000 images labeled “dog” or “cat” to train the app on how to tell which is which. After she launches the"
" app, a user can upload a photo and the app can determine if the picture contained a dog or a cat. Smart stuff."

"The term “AI” gets thrown around a lot — it’s one of those phrases you see as a bullet point on the back of a toy box or hear in commercials for IBM’s Watson. There’s a chance you’ve heard terms "
"like “algorithm” or even “machine learning model” a lot less. Algorithms power AI — they are the programs inside software that take in a bunch of information and crunch the numbers. A machine "
"learning model is what ends up making the prediction."

"An algorithm is a piece of software that can look at numerous pieces of information about a subject and classifies them. Then, when that algorithm is applied to a large set of what experts call "
"training data, it produces a machine learning model. The model is what’s able to take in new data and make choices based on the data in front of it. Did your streaming service suggest to you your "
"new favorite TV show? It was able to do that by collecting data points about you (what you’re watching, what device you’re on, what other people similar to you watch, etc.) and the streaming "
"platform’s machine learning model spits out your new favorite show, Trashy Reality Show Season 2: Miami. (Though few would call you out if you used the term “AI” or “recommendation system” here "
"instead of “machine learning model.”)"
