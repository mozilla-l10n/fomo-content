"For many, shopping on social media makes sense. Platforms like Instagram Shopping or Facebook Marketplace serve up an array of products, on an app you already spend time on, often personalised to "

"Jake Moore, security specialist at cybersecurity firm ESET, says he has seen a massive uptick in social commerce-related fraud. This can range from sellers who take consumers’ money but don’t "

"First step: do your due diligence on the seller. Look out for signs of engagement on the vendor's profile: a decent following, combined with comments and reviews. Accounts can purchase fake "
"followers, as Moore acknowledges, but he says that genuine interaction is harder to replicate, as faux followers “tend to just be represented by numbers rather than comments.” Looking to see if the "
"vendor has a verified (blue tick) account helps too, Moore says. Research in the same way you might if you were buying from any shop you’d not heard of before."
