"This is the third phase of this writing competition brought to you courtesy of Mozilla Foundation. The Mozilla Foundation, in their efforts to create Kiswahili as a machine language, have prepared a"
" Kiswahili database that includes Kiswahili dialects as well, not just standard Kiswahili. This is a project that deserves support for its efforts to identify Kiswahili and Viswahili, that even if "
"machines will be taught this language, it is important to consider the presence of dialects and its speakers. Kiswahili, as the experts say, has its own depth."

"So, save the data if created from this point of view, there is balance and what's more, this also becomes like a way to save these dialects, otherwise they will disappear and be forgotten. It will "
"be like in the eighties and nineties many schools here in Kenya forced students to speak only English, and did not appreciate their native languages. As the child continues his studies, he will "
"glorify one language and degrade other languages, especially the mother's."

"speakers of Kiswahili and its dialects can get services, for example through their phones, and the language that they know well. And it's not just service, because they will be able to participate "
"in various activities to build themselves and also develop the country such as referendum and so on."
