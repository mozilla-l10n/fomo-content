"This isn’t always a bad thing, but oftentimes it can be. For example, content that is entertaining isn’t always factually correct or safe. “Hatred is useful for clickbait,” as Guillaume Chaslot puts"

" videos that led to videos about bodily harm to drag queen self esteem videos that transitioned eventually to anti-LGBTQ content. Users of YouTube were taken to some eerie corners of the site — all "
"thanks to YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. Zoom out and this sequence of events happening repeatedly, while profitable for YouTube, can be dangerous for society."

"So what do we do about all this? For starters, you can <a id=\"a1\">chime in and tell us about a time YouTube’s suggestion bot led you astray</a>. Additionally, Chaslot recommends regulators step in"
" and issue laws that begin to curb this. But there’s something you can do as well — arm yourself with knowledge. “When you know that YouTube is trying to manipulate you, it doesn’t work as well,” "
"Chaslot says. Hate leads to clicks but only you can prevent yourself from turning to the dark side."
