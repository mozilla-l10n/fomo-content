"Air pollution poses significant environmental health risks in Africa, particularly for low-income communities. While traditional ground-based sensor networks are effective, they can be expensive to "
"deploy and maintain. This challenge leverages freely available satellite data from Sentinel-5P, Google Earth Engine, to create cost-effective air quality prediction models for eight cities in seven "
"African cities: Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaounde, Bujumbura, Kisumu, Kampala, and Gulu."

"While over 200 air quality monitors have been deployed in major African cities, they leave vast areas uncovered. The Air Quality Prediction Challenge tackles this by encouraging participants to "
"develop innovative ways to leverage satellite data. This approach aims to fill the data gaps and create a more comprehensive picture of air quality across the continent."
