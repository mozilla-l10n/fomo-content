"On Tuesday, Mozilla <a id=\"a1\">published our latest edition of *Privacy Not Included</a>, in which we outlined the privacy and security features and flaws of 15 popular video call apps. At the "
"time of publication, three of those 15 apps did not meet Mozilla’s Minimum Security Standards: Discord, Doxy.me, and HouseParty."

"Mozilla has been talking with all three apps, and as a result of those conversations, <a id=\"a1\">Discord</a> now requires stronger passwords. With this update, Discord now meets our Minimum "
"Security Standards. (Previously, Discord’s minimum password length was six characters, with no complexity detection. As recently as last week, our researchers found the password \"111111\" worked as"
" a login.) In addition to strengthening its password requirements, Discord says it prevents users from choosing a password that has been compromised by another service. It also encourages two-factor"
" authentication."

"This may seem like a small change in the grand scheme of online privacy and security. But, at a time when more people than ever before are depending on video call apps, the field is now more secure."
" Further, this change shows that privacy and security can indeed be a competitive advantage, especially in the crowded field of video call apps. When one app excels at protecting consumers’ privacy "
"and security, others are likely to follow suit."
