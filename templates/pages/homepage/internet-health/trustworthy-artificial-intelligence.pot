"The need for this work is urgent. Daily, concerning stories hit the news about the effects of AI, big data, and targeted marketing. And time and again we read that the public is losing trust in big "

"how they are made."

"<b>PRIVACY</b>: How is data collected, stored, and shared? Our personal data powers everything from traffic maps to targeted advertising. Trustworthy AI should enable people to decide how their data"

"<b>FAIRNESS</b>: We’ve seen time and again how bias shows up in computational models, data, and frameworks behind automated decision making. The values and goals of a system should be power aware "
