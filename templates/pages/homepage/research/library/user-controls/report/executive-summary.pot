"YouTube is the <a id=\"a1\">second most visited website</a> in the world, and its algorithm <a id=\"a2\">drives most of the video views on YouTube</a>. Previous <a id=\"a3\">Mozilla research</a> "
"determined that people are routinely recommended videos they don’t want to see, including violent content, hate speech, and political misinformation."

"YouTube says that people can manage their recommendations and search results through <a id=\"a1\">the feedback tools the platform offers</a>, but we heard from people that they do not feel in "
"control over their experience with the YouTube algorithm. We surveyed 2,757 participants about their feelings of control in relation to the platform and we learned that many people feel their "
"actions don’t have any effect on YouTube recommendations."

"To test whether these experiences are backed by data, we evaluated the effectiveness of these controls for real users of the platform. Powered by Mozilla’s research tool <a "
"id=\"a1\">RegretsReporter</a>, 22,722 people donated data about their interactions with YouTube. This study represents the largest experimental audit of YouTube by independent researchers, powered "
"by crowdsourced data."

"We looked at what happened over time to people’s recommended videos after they had used one of YouTube’s feedback tools – buttons like “Dislike” and “Don’t Recommend Channel.” From Dec 2021 to June "
"2022, RegretsReporter participants shared 567,880,195 video recommendations with us. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Exeter, we used a machine learning model we built to "
"analyze video similarity. Through this approach, we were able to study what kind of effect YouTube’s tools have on video recommendations for real users of the platform."

"<b>People feel that using YouTube’s user controls does not change their recommendations at all.</b> We learned that many people take a trial-and-error approach to controlling their recommendations, "

"In the report, we provide some examples of videos that were recommended after RegretsReporter participants used YouTube’s feedback tools. For example, one participant asked YouTube to stop "
"recommending firearm videos — but was shortly after recommended more gun content. Another person asked YouTube to stop recommending cryptocurrency get-rich-quick videos, but then was recommended "
"another crypto video."
