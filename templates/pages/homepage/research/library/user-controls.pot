"In this report, we present a large-scale audit Mozilla conducted on YouTube’s user controls: the tools and features people use to manage their video recommendations on YouTube. To evaluate the "
"effectiveness of these controls for real users of the platform, we collected data from 22,722 volunteers about their interactions with YouTube. We also surveyed 2,757 participants to better "
"understand their feelings of control on the platform. Building on our <a id=\"a1\">previous investigation</a> into YouTube, this study is likely the largest experimental audit of YouTube by "
"independent researchers, powered by Mozilla’s <a id=\"a2\">RegretsReporter</a>."

msgid "People don’t feel they have much control over their YouTube recommendations — and our study demonstrates they actually don’t. We determined that:"

msgctxt "overview"
msgid ""
"<b>1. People feel that using YouTube’s user controls does not change their recommendations at all.</b> We learned that many people take a trial-and-error approach to controlling their "
"recommendations, with limited success."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "overview"
msgid ""
"<b>2. YouTube’s user control mechanisms are inadequate for preventing unwanted recommendations.</b> We found that YouTube’s user controls influence what is recommended, but this effect is meager and"
" most unwanted videos still slip through."

msgid "Recommendations"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "overview"
msgid ""
"<b>1. The controls should be easy to understand and access.</b> People should be provided with clear information about the steps they can take to influence their recommendations, and should be "
"empowered to use those tools."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "overview"
msgid ""
"<b>2. YouTube should design its feedback tools in a way that puts people in the driver’s seat.</b> Feedback tools should enable people to proactively shape their experience, with user feedback given"
" more weight in determining what videos are recommended."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "overview"
msgid "<b>3. YouTube should enhance its data access tools.</b> YouTube should provide researchers with access to better tools that allow them to assess the signals that impact YouTube's algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "overview"
msgid "<b>4. Policymakers should protect public interest researchers.</b> Policymakers should pass and/or clarify laws that provide legal protections for public interest research."
