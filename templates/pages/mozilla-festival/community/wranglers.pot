"Mozilla Festival is shared by design. Mozilla gives Wranglers driving lessons, and then hands them the keys to the car. In turn, they chart a map that Facilitators use to make the schedule come to "
"life. Those Facilitators then take participants on a ride that inspires them to take action in their local communities. The Volunteers are the mechanics that ensure our adventure runs smoothly each "
"step of the way."
