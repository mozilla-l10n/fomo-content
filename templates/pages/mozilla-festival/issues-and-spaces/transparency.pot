"As AI systems grow in complexity and use in society, we know less and less about how they actually work. AI systems that drive everyday interactions and decisions are not always auditable and "

"Join forces with us at MozFest to build tech and systems that promote responsible and informative transparency, and tackle questions such as: How can transparency lead to accountability? What do "
"users, researchers, regulators, and platforms need to effectively interrogate AI systems? And what can we learn from existing cultures of transparency, like open source?"
