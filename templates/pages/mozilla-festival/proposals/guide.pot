"movement. The Sessions are where we share our work and exchange thoughts &amp; experiences, through discussions, workshops, art installations, films, or cultural and social moments. On 11 October, "
"the Call for Proposals will go live and you are all invited to explore the issues of each Space through the submission of a session that seeks collaboration, engagement and co-building with others "
