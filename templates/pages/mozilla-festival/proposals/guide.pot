"At MozFest we ask the internet health movement to connect, collaborate, and build Trustworthy AI, whether in products, policies, design principles, community resources, or guidelines. Core issues "
"felt across the internet health movement emerge as Spaces, tracks for co-creation and community building, which are hosted by our Wranglers, volunteer curators from across the Internet health "
"movement. The Sessions are where we share our work and exchange thoughts &amp; experiences, through discussions, workshops, art installations, films, or cultural and social moments. On 11 October, "
"the Call for Proposals will go live and you are all invited to explore the issues of each Space through the submission of a session that seeks collaboration, engagement and co-building with others "
