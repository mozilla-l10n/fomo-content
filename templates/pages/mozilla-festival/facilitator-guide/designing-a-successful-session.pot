"Your facilitator experience should be engaging and each session should hold space for collaboration and conversation. MozFest receives a diverse and global audience who come into the festival each "

"MozFest emphasises three Facilitation Principles: Participation, Accessibility, and Inclusivity. Facilitating at MozFest is what makes the festival unique. Unlike a traditional conference, we "
"highlight the platforming of voices and the participatory nature of sessions. Facilitating at MozFest means creating space for others to collaborate, create and conspire. Rather than acting as "
"speakers or presenters, Facilitators should involve their audiences in their sessions as much as possible - emphasising on participation and shared visions for the outcome of the session."

"It is equally as important to make sure sessions are Accessible and Inclusive of all. MozFest is an open and non-discriminatory space, and Facilitators should design sessions that honour these "
