"It’s tempting to tell you to simply sit back and relax: allow your son unstructured, exploratory free-play, climbing trees and skinning knees, safe in the knowledge that whether he ends up as a "
"rocket scientist or a teacher, there are many ways to give back to the world. Perhaps you’ll want to give him space to forge his own understanding of meaning, and assure him of your unconditional "

"But first he has to get there. Start small, by focusing him on a founder mentality. Rebrand his pocket money as seed capital, and tell him you expect a 100x return on his lemonade stand. Add "
"generous amounts of salt to the lemonade while he’s looking away: He needs to experience failure early to get that all-important chip on his shoulder."

"The right home environment is a crucial part of your son’s development. He’ll need to practice his elevator pitch, so you’ll need elevators. Move to the tallest apartment building near you, where "
"your son will be able to practice timing and delivery as he rides up and down every day. Create a positive feedback loop by jamming the elevator with a crowbar whenever he stutters."

"Total control and a refusal to compromise are a big part of becoming a tech billionaire. So instead of team sports, steer your son towards solo sports like bowling and archery. He’ll learn a "
"valuable lesson: To do it properly, you have to go it alone. Help him gain resilience by resisting the urge to cheer during his competitions — a polite cough every now and then will do."

"Maybe you’ll worry about being a little hard on him, but that’s exactly the point. Think about how great this origin story will sound in pitches, in crazy-eyed speeches to cowed employees, in the "
"first chapter of your son’s biography. Ask yourself, what matters more: the selfish short-term rush of giving your child love and receiving it in return? Or the greater good of your son becoming "

"A note on timing: your son’s entrepreneurial career mustn’t wait until he graduates. Dropping out of school is key to becoming a successful founder; the only risk is that he waits until college to "
"do it. So have a frank discussion about the lengthy road to product-market fit. Give him all the facts: if he goes full-time as a founder by age eleven, that’s a ten-year edge on most of his "
"competitors. They’ll be wasting time with their first crush — he’ll be crushing it with his first startup."
