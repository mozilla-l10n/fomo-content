"Of course you have to get key plays right, Blandino says, but how precise do we need to be on a random second-and-8? He thinks about the NBA, where you often see a defender knock a ball out of "

"other way. In baseball, we now have the phenomenon of a base-stealer easily beating the catcher’s throw, only for his body to slide off the bag for a millisecond while the tag is being applied—and "
