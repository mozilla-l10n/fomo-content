"iMessage defaults to sending texts through Apple’s servers using end-to-end encryption. Although iOS can also send texts as SMS through the GSM network if it can’t reach the iMessage network, this "

"However, Apple’s messaging infrastructure isn’t open source and it’s entirely possible that Apple could be collecting significant amounts of metadata as routing your message to a contact is "

"Instead, iMessage sends a message that’s encrypted between you and Apple’s servers. Once it reaches Apple’s servers, it’s decrypted in RAM, meaning that the messages are never saved to a hard drive."
