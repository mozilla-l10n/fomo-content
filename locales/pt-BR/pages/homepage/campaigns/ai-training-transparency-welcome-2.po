"Generative AI models are trained on terabytes of web crawl data from across the internet. One of the most popular sources of training data is Common Crawl, a massive archive of web crawl data "
"created by a small nonprofit. Mozilla’s latest investigation shows that Common Crawl has helped to make generative AI development more transparent and competitive, but AI builders need to be "
"transparent about how they use such data because it reflects the internet’s biases and contains content that is toxic and harmful. <b>Yet we don’t even know if big AI companies like Microsoft, "
"Google or Meta are using Common Crawl to train their AI products, let alone how they filtered out harmful content.</b>"
