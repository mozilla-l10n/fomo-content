"<b>(SAN FRANCISCO, CA | NOVEMBER 15, 2023)</b> -- They see you when you’re sleeping, they know when you’re awake: The season’s hottest connected tech gifts are lending Santa’s elves a lot of "

"According to Mozilla’s <a id=\"a1\">2023 *Privacy Not Included holiday buyers’ guide</a>, children’s connected toys and apps — which collect and repurpose hoards of data — are among the worst in "

"Companies’ privacy policies are also getting more opaque and dishonest. <b>Embodied Inc’</b>s privacy policy tells parents to teach their kids not to share personal information with their Moxie "
"learning robot — yet the product’s marketing simultaneously encourages kids to hone skills like emotional regulation and self-confidence. Other companies also often market smartwatches to parents of"
" children too young for first phones. Researchers found many privacy concerns here, including one, the <b>Angel Watch</b> for kids, that tracks intimate data like location, audio, video, cellular "
"calling, and body vitals, and doesn't even seem to have a privacy policy that covers the smart watch or app at all – amounting to one of the creepiest products *PNI has ever reviewed."

"Meanwhile, many companies that Mozilla researchers previously rated positively — including <b>Sonos</b>, <b>Eufy</b>, and <b>Bose</b> — have earned new privacy warning labels this year. Others that "
"already carried warning labels, like <b>Amazon</b>, <b>Samsung</b>, <b>Wyze</b> and <b>Microsoft XBox</b> got even worse on data collection, use, sharing, and security. Wyze had serious security "
"vulnerabilities that it was slow to respond to over the past couple of years, and Bose now says it can possibly sell data on users’ head movements while using headphones. FTC charges and fines "
"against Amazon and Microsoft have confirmed researchers’ concerns about those products’ privacy violations, especially when it comes to children’s uses."
