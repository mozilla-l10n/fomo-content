"Recent breakthroughs in language modeling are powered by large collections of natural language datasets. This has triggered an arms race to train models on disparate collections of incorrectly, "

"2,000+ popular, text-to-text fine-tuning datasets from origin to creation, cataloging their data sources, licenses, creators, and other metadata, for researchers and developers to explore using this"
