"Zoom’s popularity went from 0 to 60 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Its daily meeting participants grew from 10 million to over 300 million in just a few months. With so many more "
"people working, schooling, and socializing from home, Zoom became a favorite video call app for many because of its high video quality, call recording, and ease of use. With Zoom’s rapid growth came"
" a number of growing pains. Like the phenomena known as Zoombombing, when strangers, often with bad intent, invade video calls and cause problems. Full disclosure, here at Mozilla we use Zoom and "
"have worked closely with the company to get its privacy and security features right for us."

"Zoom’s privacy and security problems since 2020 are well documented -- not being completely honest about it being fully end-to-end encrypted, security flaws the company failed to disclose, "
"zoomboomings that included abuse and hate speech, over 500,000 users accounts up for sale on the dark web, a lawsuit filed because Facebook was allegedly allowed to \"eavesdrop\" on Zoom users' "
"personal data. The list of failures and vulnerabilities is long. So, have they gotten better? Zoom has acknowledged their mistakes and appears to be invested in fixing them, for the most part. As of"
" July 2021, end-to-end encryption is in technical preview. Because it disables several features. Zoom recommends using end-to-end encryption only for meetings where additional protection is needed. "
"And Zoom says it does not sell personal information. Zoom does share personal information with third-parties for advertising and other purposes. This sharing of data is fairly common with many "
"similar video call apps we reviewed like Microsoft Teams and Cisco Webex doing the same thing. All in all, Zoom is an OK video call app for most purposes. Still, given Zoom’s many very public "
"missteps over the past couple of years, we really hope they keep working to get better at both privacy and security."
