"Let’s face it, vacuuming sucks. Throw in some pets or kids and this Sisyphean task can drain your soul. Well, hello Roomba! This robot vacuum does the work for you. These robot vacuums map your "
"house, can tell the kitchen from the dinner room, and will vacuum with a \"Hey Google, clean up under the table\" voice command. A truly wonderful invention. And if you've been scarred by watching "
"those videos where they smear poop all over the floor, your worries are (hopefully) over. Roombas learned how to avoid dog poo. Technological advances are truly a wonder. Poo aside, maybe the best "
"thing about iRobot's Roombas is, they're actually pretty good at privacy and security. For now. Who knows if they'll stay that way after Amazon's purchase of iRobot goes through?"

"iRobot and their robot vacuums have been the good guys when it comes to privacy. That’s why they made our “Best Of” list year after year. And why <a id=\"a1\">Consumer Reports named them</a> the "
"most privacy and secure robot vacuums they review back in 2021. Shoot, we even hired an independent cybersecurity firm to look into iRobot Roomba’s privacy and security in 2022 and they came back "

"So when we read that screenshots of a <a id=\"a1\">woman on the toilet</a> recorded by a Roomba ended up on Facebook -- many people’s <a id=\"a2\">worst fear</a> about robot vacuums -- we were "
"pretty bummed. iRobot confirmed that the screenshots did come from Roomba recordings from 2020, but said they were from a test run of vacuums. They said the people using those vacuums signed special"
" agreements that recordings would be sent back to the company for training. It’s not clear though whether these people knew that the videos could be watched, reviewed, and screenshotted by humans. "
"(We’re guessing not.) And I’m sure that they could end up on social media definitely wasn’t part of the deal. Ouff, that's not \"Best Of\" behavior, iRobot. The good news is, those were test robots "

"There’s more bad news for iRobot. Before the toilet fiasco, we were already <a id=\"a1\">a little worried</a>. The reason we asked an independent cybersecurity firm to look into iRobot’s robot "
"vacuum cleaners in the first place is because we wanted to confirm that they are as good at privacy and security as we thought (and it seems they are). Because not-very-good-guy <a id=\"a2\">Amazon "
"announced in August, 2022</a> that they are acquiring good guy iRobot for about $1.7 billion (the Amazon deal hasn't gone through yet, but <a id=\"a3\">it could be finalized as soon as February "

"<a id=\"a1\">Here’s why</a>: Amazon loves data. As <a id=\"a2\">many experts</a> were quick to point out, they like to know as much about you as they can so they can target you with the ads and "
"product recommendations that will sell you more stuff. iRobot’s <a id=\"a3\">privacy policy</a> says they can collect lots of data about you and your home -- things like your home’s floor plan, the "
"objects in your home and where they are located, cleaning schedules, your location, name, email, device and advertising IDs, and even images from your home if you chose to share those from their "
"vacuums that use camera-based navigation. That’s a lot of <a id=\"a4\">info about your and your home</a> that Amazon could potentially use to know more about you, target you with ads, and sell you "

"iRobot currently makes it fairly clear they want to do a good job protecting and respecting all the data their little roving vacuum robots can collect. They don’t sell your data (neither will "
"Amazon, but Amazon doesn’t need to as they are the advertising giant others pay to use the data they have on you to target you with ads and promotions). iRobot also says they won’t share your "
"personal information for third party advertising (they may share some app and website usage info for targeted advertising…this is super common). This is good. However, we can’t say Amazon will do "
"the same. <a id=\"a1\">Amazon wants to own that data</a> on you to target you with more ads and sell you more stuff. <a id=\"a2\">As one privacy expert put it</a>, “<i>People tend to think of Amazon"
" as an online seller company, but really Amazon is a surveillance company. That is the core of its business model, and that’s what drives its monopoly power and profit,</i>” says Evan Greer, "

"All this makes it feel quaint that a few years back iRobot got into a <a id=\"a1\">bit of hot water</a> because it appeared they were mapping users' homes with their Roomba robot vacuum cleaners "
"with potential plans to sell that data. Since then, <a id=\"a2\">iRobot stepped up</a> and made it a point to show they don't sell users' personal data about their lives or homes. And you can choose"

"What’s the worst that could happen? Well, the sale of iRobot to Amazon will likely go through. Once Amazon takes over, iRobot's privacy could take a turn for the worst. And all those people who "
"bought a Roomba partly because they were good at privacy could now have their personal information transferred over to Amazon as part of the sale. And now Amazon could have a floor plan mapping, "
"objects in your home tracking, roving camera sending data back to the retail and ad targeting Big Tech giant. And, well, your privacy could never be the same. <i>Dear Amazon, would you please not "
