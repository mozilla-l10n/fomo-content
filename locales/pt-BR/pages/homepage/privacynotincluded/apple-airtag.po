"Losing your stuff stinks. Finding your stuff is amazing. Apple entered the tiny Bluetooth tracker game with their new AirTags. These little, round trackers can slip into or be attached to almost "
"anything. Once there, you can track your stuff — wallets, backpacks, cars, your favorite teddy bear — as easily as saying, \"Hey Siri, where's teddy?\" A speaker on the tracker will let you know "
"where it's at if you are in Bluetooth range. You can also use the Find My app to tap into the community of millions iPhone, iPad, and Mac users around the world to also help track your tiny tracker."
" Yes, there are privacy concerns. Yes, Apple has taken steps to address these privacy concerns. Here's hoping it's enough."

"Apple’s AirTags raised a bit of a fuss when they launched early in 2021. <a id=\"a1\">Every review</a> we saw said two things about the Airtags and the <a id=\"a2\">Find My app</a> they use on iOS "
"devices. One, they work great. Two, they <a id=\"a3\">might work too great</a>. The <a id=\"a4\">problem</a>? They seemed <a id=\"a5\">too easy to use</a> to track non-consenting humans <a "

"Fortunately, Apple listened to their users and made some quick changes to <a id=\"a1\">mitigate these concerns</a>, like shortening the time it takes for an AirTag to play a sound after it is "
"separated from its owner from three days to between 8 - 24 hours to help alert someone who might have had an Airtag slipped in their bag or car as a way to stalk them. Unfortunately, those changes "
"still weren’t enough, so in February 2022, <a id=\"a2\">Apple announced even more updates</a> to AirTags, the Find My app, and to how Apple interacts with law enforcement to <a id=\"a3\">help with "
"unwanted tracking</a>. <a id=\"a4\">Some experts say</a> there is still more work to be done as the stories pile up of people being <a id=\"a5\">tracked or stalked</a> without their knowledge or "

"As for Apple’s privacy practices, well, Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. They have had some serious security issues, including <a id=\"a1\">one in 2022</a> that "
"could allow hackers to take complete control of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. And another bad <a id=\"a2\">security vulnerability</a> that resulted in spyware that could allow bad actors to record calls"
" and messages and even turn the device camera and microphone on without the user knowing. The good thing with Apple and security is, they seem to take these security breaches seriously, jump and fix"
" them immediately, and communicate pretty well with users on what they need to do to stay safe. So keep those devices updated folks! And take those security warnings seriously when you get them. "
"This is also a good reminder that even the best companies can be vulnerable to high-level security bugs and breaches."

"When it comes to AI voice assistants, Siri is a bit more privacy conscious than others like Amazon’s Alexa. Apple says they <a id=\"a1\">take special care</a> to make sure your Siri requests aren't "

"controlling music are no longer sent over the internet to their servers, instead they are processed directly on the Homepod. And any information used to personalize things for you across your Apple "
"devices is synced over iCloud using end-to-end encryption. All this is good for your privacy. Apple did <a id=\"a3\">face backlash in 2019</a> when it came to light their contractors were regularly "

"the internet that tell people how to modify or disable the speaker in the AirTag so it can’t alert someone it’s been hidden in their car or purse. A bad person using an AirTag to stalk someone "
"without them knowing is pretty dang creepy. But, that could also happen with any of the Bluetooth trackers on the market. It’s just that Apple’s Find My network is huge, with millions of users, "
