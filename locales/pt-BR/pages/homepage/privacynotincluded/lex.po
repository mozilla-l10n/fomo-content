"Ah, Lex. The once simple lesbian, bisexual, and trans focused text-based anti-dating dating app has changed. Sometimes change is good...sometimes it's not. In the <a id=\"a1\">case of Lex</a>, well,"
" if you're a queer person looking for community, change is good. If you're a queer person looking for sexy romance, maybe change isn't so good. What was once a simple, text-based personal ads that "
"harkened back to ads found in lesbian erotica publication <i>On Our Backs,</i> has<a id=\"a2\"> evolved</a> into a community based <i>\"vibrant social platform.\"</i> Of course, that evolution "
"involved raising a few million in start up money and looking for ways to monetize the platform. Such is the way of life in under capitalism. The for-sure-good news? Lex still gets a thumbs up from "
"us. Woohooo!"

"Thank goodness for Lex. This global queer community app is the only dating app we reviewed in 2024 to earn our Best Of distinction. Phew! Now because of a <a id=\"a1\">recent redesign</a>, the app "
"does collect more personal data than it used to when we first reviewed (and loved) them back in 2021. But c’est la vie in 2024! And more importantly, we don't see any red flags about how that data "
"is handled. Based on their privacy practices and our conversations with Lex, they seem to be doing their best to protect their users' privacy which is sadly rare in the dating app space. We see you,"
" Lex!"

"To use Lex, you have to give your phone number or Instagram handle. We suggest not using a third-party app to create a new account -- especially when that other app is owned by a member of the "
"*Privacy Not Included hall of shame, like Meta’s Instagram. When you do, it means both apps can potentially collect more information about you. And Meta already has enough of our private data."

"Besides your login, Lex will collect registration basics like your name, email, preferred pronouns, and username. That’s pretty standard stuff. In case it’s not clear in the app, that means you "
"don’t have to add a profile photo or give Lex access to your geolocation. Know that if you don’t, you won't be able to use all the <a id=\"a1\">app’s features</a>. But if you do add your location, "
"“it’s not possible to undo it,” Lex says. There’s also your posts and the messages you send through the app. And like most apps, Lex collects some information automatically, like potentially "
"everything you do on the app and information about your device, which includes your IP address."

"It could add up to a decent amount of information about you. So it's cool that all Lex users <a id=\"a1\">have the right</a> to have their personal data deleted, \"no questions asked!\" At first, we"
" weren't 100% sure if that really meany <i>all</i> users -- even those who don't live in places with stronger privacy laws. But when we emailed Lex to ask, they confirmed that it did AND updated "
"their privacy policy right away to make that part crystal clear. Smooth move, Lex!"

"And Lex won't sell your personal information or use it in ways that worry us too much. They do say they can use “aggregated or de-identified” data for “any legitimate business purpose.” In case that"

"So Lex is pretty good overall and they do use good enough security measures to keep your personal data safe. We don't think too much could go too wrong with Lex. But we'll close with a caution from "

"transmit your personal data to us, you do so at your own risk.\"</i> That’s true for all apps and products that connect to the internet, but feels especially important if you're a lesbian, non-"
"binary, trans, or gender non-conforming person who’s not out or who wouldn't feel safe being identified as a user of a queer community app."
