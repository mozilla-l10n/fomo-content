"Feeling lonely? Need someone to talk to? Looking for an \"AI soulmate?\" Well, AI chatbot Replika wants to be your VR BFF. Whether you're looking for a friend, mentor, or partner, Replika claims be "
"able to offer you the perfect companion. For a price, you can even upgrade your relationship status to Romantic Partner -- unlocking new topics, voice calls, and the ability to change your Replika's"
" avatar entirely when you get bored. Chat about everything with your Replika and this AI chatbot becomes smarter about how to chat back with you. You can even hang out with your AI in \"real life\" "
"through the magic of Augmented Reality. Cool, cool. But how does Replika do with privacy? Well, good luck opting out of cookies on their website, that's not an option. As for those personal and "
"intimate chats, those probably aren't shared but that doesn't mean all that time you spend chatting up with your AI friend isn't noted and shared with the likes of Facebook or Google."

"they say they can use the contents of your chats for. Things like “<i>analyzing the use and effectiveness of [their] services,”</i> and “<i>developing [their] business and marketing strategies.”</i>"
" We're also wondering how much of your sensitive personal chat information they use to train their AI models. They don't mention that specifically in their privacy policy and we would like to see "

"Replika's privacy policy goes on to say they can aggregate, anonymize, and de-identify the contents of your chats to do things like improve their services and develop marketing strategies. This "

"personal information with Replika in your chats, you really have to trust that they are going to protect and respect the privacy of those conversations. On that note, we think you should take this "

"Hey, speaking of their marketing strategies, they’re a bit creepy and icky too. They’ve been criticized on social media and beyond as being <a id=\"a1\">cringe</a> at best, and <a "
"id=\"a2\">predatory</a> at worst because they seem to be laser-focused on the lonely guys looking for... love, or something like that. And that sort of friendship/relationship/sexting pal did track "
"with Replika's services, until early in 2023. The paid version used to unlock a spicier relationship with your Replika that included sexting. And you might be like “well if they’re consenting "
"adults…” and that’s the thing: People complained that the Replikas were coming on way too strong, even turning aggressive and <a id=\"a3\">abusive</a>. So Replika turned off the NSFW stuff, but that"
" move caught some subscribers super off-guard and apparently left some <a id=\"a4\">heartbroken</a>. Which goes to show how much these robo-friends can impact real people. In response, Replika "

"they're over 18 in the app -- but that's actually kinda weird because both the App Store and the Google Play store say it's a-okay for users just 17+. And we're sure any underage legacy users "
