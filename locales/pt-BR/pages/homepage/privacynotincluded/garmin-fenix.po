"Garmin's Fenix line of watches -- which include solar versions, small and large versions, and even ones with super scratch resistant glass -- aren't cheap. You can drop $1,000 dollars on these "
"watches that do all the smart watch things like heart rate, pulse ox, respiratory rate, stress, sleep, and more. These shiny wrist gadgets also offer GPS navigation, topographic maps right on your "
"wrist, and a built-in flashlight just in case you still get lost in the dark. All this is great, but how about their privacy? Well, fortunately, Garmin's privacy is pretty good."

"When your *Privacy Not Included researcher wanted to get a fitness tracking smartwatch to see how stressed out reading privacy policies made her, Garmin is what she went with. Because Garmin seems "

"Here’s what this privacy researcher likes about Garmin. Yes, they do collect a good bit of personal information through the device and on the Garmin Connect app because that’s what a fitness "
"tracking smartwatch does. They collect data like email address, device information, location, and all that body related data like physical activity, stress, sleep patterns, heat rate, pulse ox, and "

"Your “sharing with others” user settings in the Garmin Connect app are set to “private” by default. Which is great. You can choose to share your data with contacts if you wish, but you have to "
"change your privacy settings to do that. Good work Garmin. Garmin also doesn’t share your personal information for advertising purposes with third parties. They ask you to opt-in rather than opt-out"
" of consent to receive marketing communications from them. And their privacy policy is actually pretty good at laying out what data they collect, clearly explaining why they collect it, and how it "

"Garmin isn’t 100% perfect though. We do ding them because they don’t make it clear in their privacy policy that all users -- regardless of where they live and the privacy laws they live under -- "
"have the same right to access and delete their data. Garmin told us they don’t deny any user those requests. However, it seems based on the way their privacy policy is worded, they could. Garmin "
"told us they would revisit the wording in their privacy policy on this issue. Here’s hoping they make an update to clarify that soon."

"Is your intrepid privacy researcher happy with her decision to get a Garmin fitness tracker? Yes, she is. Although it does make her a little nervous that she now leaves her <a id=\"a1\">phone's "

"but do beware if you link your data to other third party apps like Strava and MyFitnessPal. Those apps come with their own privacy policies and every time you share your personal information with "
