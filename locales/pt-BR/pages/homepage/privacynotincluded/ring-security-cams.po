"Amazon Ring's indoor and outdoor security cameras have all the usual--HD video, night vision, motion activation--to put your house under 24-hour surveillance. Monitor the video through the Ring app "

"Amazon’s Ring security cameras and video doorbells are the <a id=\"a1\">most widely used</a> home video cameras in many parts of the world today. As one expert from US privacy org the Electronic "
"Frontier Foundation <a id=\"a2\">put it</a>, \"Ring has steadily been becoming one of the largest surveillance apparatuses in the nation.” And as wise comic book profit Stan Lee reminds us, “With "
"great power comes great responsibility.” Has Amazon Ring lived up to that great responsibility? <a id=\"a3\">No, they haven’t</a>. And if you’re checking in to see if, in 2023, Ring has improved "
"their privacy practices after sooo very many complaints, the short answer is no, not enough."

"On the bright side, Amazon is starting to be held accountable for some of their more “egregious violations of users’ privacy” described in a <a id=\"a1\">proposed order</a> filed by the FTC in May "
"of 2023. Like when they <a id=\"a2\">stored customer data</a>--including video recordings--unencrypted on an Amazon cloud server and gave every employee and even some third party contractors access."
" The FTC’s <a id=\"a3\">complaint</a> also says Ring had failed to keep customers’ sensitive data secure, which made it easy for bad actors to get <a id=\"a4\">access</a> to sensitive data too. "
"Since those colossal blunders, they have gotten more transparent in their privacy and data deletion practices, which we appreciate. And they added <a id=\"a5\">two-factor authentication</a> to help "
"protect users in 2020, which was a great step forward. One we here at Mozilla <a id=\"a6\">pushed hard</a> for. But, we’re still pushing. In June, 2023 we <a id=\"a7\">published</a> a security "
"vulnerability impacting Ring’s security after Amazon failed to take action on it for over 90 days. As far as we can tell, they still haven't fixed this vulnerability. So when it comes to Amazon "

"Then there is the <a id=\"a1\">problematic relationship</a> Ring has with law enforcement where <a id=\"a2\">questions</a> of racism, <a id=\"a3\">warrantless surveillance</a>, and police overreach "

"facilitating law enforcement access with this product and the <a id=\"a5\">Neighbors app</a> and that leaves us concerned. They also admitted in 2022 they <a id=\"a6\">still share video with law "
"enforcement</a> without users’ permission in some circumstances. And even when Ring does require a court order, that often doesn’t give Americans as much protection as you’d think. That’s because "
"Ring doesn’t have a good <a id=\"a7\">track record</a> of pushing back on far-reaching warrants for their users’ video recordings of and inside their homes. That really worries us since Ring "
"reportedly receives thousands of search warrants each year -- a number that’s growing."
