"This powerful little Bluetooth vibrator is designed to be worn in the bedroom while claiming to be discreet enough to be worn outside of it too. When connected to the Lovense Remote app, the "
"vibrator can be controlled via Bluetooth at close range—up to 20-45 feet—or over long distance through the Internet. You or your partner can control vibration amount, pattern, and intensity through "
"the app. You can even sync your vibrations to music or use the app for hands free solo play. It is USB rechargeable with up to 3 hours of continuous use per charge, so hopefully no worries of it "
"dying at an inopportune moment. And if you're looking to combine sex and fitness, a company recently released a special O-Seat for Peloton bikes that lets you attach your Lush to the seat and ride "
"it and the bike all at the same time. Teledildonic wonders never cease!"

"Lovense seems to do a pretty good job protecting users privacy and security. We love that they don't sell any user data they collect. They do collect and use personal information for things like "
"third party analytics service providers and advertising partners if users chose to share that data, which is a fairly common practice so it doesn't worry us too much. Their privacy policy and "
"privacy FAQ are written in fairly easy to understand language so users can know what types of data they collect, how they use it, and how long they keep it which is great. And everything you do over"
" the app is encrypted, so your sexy time chats and pictures can't easily be seen by random people. The Lush 2 is a vibrator that connects to an app through Bluetooth and that app can be controlled "
"over the internet, so it's not completely risk free. There's always a chance someone—a jilted lover, a kid who learns their parent's password—could gain access to the app and see some pretty "
"personal information or worse, jack your vibrator up to its highest setting and give you a jolt you weren't expecting."
