"The study – “See No Evil: How Loopholes in the Google Play Store’s Data Safety Labels Leave Companies in the Clear and Consumers in the Dark,” – uncovers serious loopholes in the <a id=\"a1\">Data "
"Safety Form</a>, which make it easy for apps to provide false or misleading information. For example, Google exempts apps sharing data with “service providers” from its disclosure requirements, "
"which is problematic due to both the narrow definition it uses for service providers and the large amount of consumer data involved. Google absolves itself of the responsibility to verify whether "
"the information is true stating that apps “are responsible for making complete and accurate declarations” in their Data Safety labels."

"Noting a <a id=\"a1\">2021 Washington Post investigation</a> that found similar problems with the Apple App Store’s labels, Caltrider said the study also brings into question whether Google and "
"Apple can objectively police the safety of apps in their stores. Google Play and the App Store generated gross revenues of <a id=\"a2\">approximately $48 billion U.S. dollars</a> and <a "
"id=\"a3\">$60 billion</a>, respectively, through mobile apps in 2021. On the heels of the Biden administration <a id=\"a4\">accusing</a> both app stores of playing “a significant gatekeeping role by"
" controlling (and restricting) how apps are distributed,” Caltrider said it’s critical the tech industry take steps to create standardized data privacy labels much like the nutrition labels now "
"found on packaged goods and fast food menus."
