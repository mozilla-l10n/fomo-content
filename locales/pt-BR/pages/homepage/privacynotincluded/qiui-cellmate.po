"Love hurts. That's the slogan on the website for the Cellmate chastity cage. The Bluetooth connected Cellmate comes in a long and a short version and touts smoother edges to reduce chafing, a "
"waterproof design, and a built-in timer lock that users can't unlock for the duration. Qiui has also added a way for users to let anyone, anywhere in the world unlock the device over the internet "
"with a digital key. Groovy. Too bad this connected chastity cage keeps popping up in the news because seems the app used to control it is easy to hack, potentially letting bad guys lock your "
"chastity cage and charge a ransom to remove it. It does clearly say on the website, \"QIUI believes that a true chastity experience is one that does not allow the wearer to have any control over,\" "
"so maybe that's part of the fun?"

msgid ""
"Uhm...well, the obvious worst thing that could happen is the app used to control this chastity cage gets hacked and your bits and pieces get trapped by a bad person looking to blackmail you for a "
"whole bunch of money to get them untrapped. That sounds pretty awful. Do we really need to say more? We will say more. There's also a terribly translated privacy policy lacking a lot of detail only "
"found within the app, so we're not real certain we know what data they are collecting on your chastity cage habits or how they use this data. We'd say stay away from this particular toy, unless the "
"risk of a hacker hacking your chastity cage and trapping your bits and pieces is your thing. Then by all means, go for it!"
