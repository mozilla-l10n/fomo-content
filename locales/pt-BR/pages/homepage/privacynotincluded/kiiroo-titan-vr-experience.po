"Kiiroo seems to do a pretty good job protecting users' privacy and security. The FeelConnect app used to control Kiiroo devices only collects and stores a small amount of user information like "
"username and password. Other types of information like phone, location, and microphone data is not collected by the company. We love that they don't sell any user data they collect. They do collect "
"and use anonymized data with third parties for analytics which is a fairly common practice so it doesn't worry us too much. The Onyx+ is a masturbator that connects to an app over Bluetooth and that"
" app can be controlled over the internet, so it's not completely risk free. There's always a chance someone could see your Bluetooth connection from the hotel room next to yours while you are "
"traveling, have the ability to hijack your Bluetooth connection, take control of those nine vibrating bullets and test your stamina in ways you didn't exactly foresee."
