"The second big concern we have about Google is their track record at being honest and respecting all this personal information they collect on us. Google has racked up quite a long list of fines for"

"Google $57 million for \"\"failing to acknowledge how its users' data is processed.\"\" Those are just the fines and lawsuits that have happened since we last reviewed Google in 2022. Over the past "
