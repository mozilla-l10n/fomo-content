"If you're more the sporty type or if you just don't like wearing big, over the ear headphones, Jabra's Elite series of little earbuds might be for you. They do all the things: noise cancelling, "
"custom sound levels for music, multiple microphones for calls, filtering out noise, and listening for you to ask Alexa, Siri, or Google to play that next song with up to 32 hours of battery life. "
"The latest models, Elite 8 Active and Elite 10, might even be the toughest, <a id=\"a1\">most advanced earbuds</a> ever? Wow! All shoved right into your ears. Best of all, Jabra seems happy to sell "
"you their earbuds and not sell your data."

"Jabra -- a Denmark based company who privacy policy follows the EU's<a id=\"a1\">GDPR privacy laws</a> (which are way better than the privacy laws the US has...as the US doesn't have a federal "
"consumer privacy law) seems to do a good job with privacy and security. For the most part, they sell hardware (their snazzy headphones), not you. They say clearly in their privacy policy, <i>“under "
"no circumstances will jabra sell your personal information.</i>” This is good. They do say they can share some personal information with third parties, which is pretty normal, and they add that, "
