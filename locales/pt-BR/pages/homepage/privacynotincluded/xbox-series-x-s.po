"Here's what we can tell you from our read of Microsoft's privacy policy in regards to Xbox -- your privacy might not be not included. The good news is, Microsoft says they don't sell your personal "

" even more data on you from places like data brokers, social networks, partners, developers, and more and combine that data with data they have on you to do things like target you with more "

"And here's the very bad when it comes to Xbox. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)<a id=\"a1\"> filed a $20 million settlement</a> against Microsoft in 2023 for alleged violations of the "

"signed up for Xbox services and failed to tell parents' about the full amount of data collected on kids under 13. And then Microsoft likely kept some of this personal information for way longer than"

"parties, such as data brokers. Also, be aware, some of the games you play on the Xbox that are made by other companies might be collecting and sharing your data and their privacy policies would "
