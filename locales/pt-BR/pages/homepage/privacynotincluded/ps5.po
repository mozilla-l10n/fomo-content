"Sony's PS5 has been around since 2020 and demand is still so high it's tough to buy one. The PS5 comes in both a regular edition with a disc drive and the cheaper digital edition without the drive. "
"Beefed up power and high-quality graphical output make games like God of War Ragnarok, Horizon Forbidden West, and Marvel's Spiderman: Miles Morales, fast and beautiful. All that, and they aren't "
"terrible at privacy either. Here's hoping you find one this year!"

"Not gonna lie, this privacy researcher loves her PS5. I also recognize it collects and shares lots of information on me. Things like name, email, phone number, location, and lots and lots of device "
"information and info on how much I game (not that much, really, I’m too busy reading privacy policies), when I game, how good I am at gaming (pretty terrible, actually). Sony knows what obstacles I "
"jump in a game, what levels I reach, who I play against, how many times I die, and more. Am I worried Sony knows I’m terrible at racing games, while kinda obsessed with Kassandra from Assassins "
"Creed Odyssey? No, not really. It’s not like this is super sensitive data like is shared with, say, <a id=\"a1\">mental health apps</a>."

"Sony does say in their <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> they can collect information from third parties and combine that with data they already have on you. Fortunately, they lay out who those third "
"parties generally are and for what purposes, so that’s nice. We sure hope they aren’t collecting any data on you from data brokers. But they can collect data on you from others users you are linked "

"Sony says they can use all the information they collect on you for things like targeted marketing and advertisements they show on their own and third-party websites and services. This isn’t great. "

"Also with the PS5, Sony now <a id=\"a1\">records all voice chats</a> in order to combat abuse during online gaming. Users experiencing abuse can submit recordings--no more than 40 seconds--of "
"abusive voice interactions to Sony for review. There will be no way to opt out of this. This <a id=\"a2\">tug-of-war between privacy and safety</a> feels mostly fine to us, because something needs "
"to be done about abuse in online gaming, especially abuse targeting women gamers. Just know, if you use the voice chat features on the new PS5 you are being recorded, although <a id=\"a3\">not "

"What’s the worst that could happen with your PS5? Well, it’s always smart to <a id=\"a1\">set up two-factor authentication</a> to keep bad people from sneaking into your PlayStation account and "
"buying a bunch of games at your expense. That could be costly and you don’t want that headache. And it’s good to be mindful all your voice chats are being recorded, so probably good to not shout out"
" your social security number over voice chat (duh). All in all though, it seems from this gamer’s perspective the biggest privacy worry comes <a id=\"a2\">when non-male gamers try to talk over voice"
" chat</a> and <a id=\"a3\">get harassed out of the games</a> by immature people. That really does need to stop."
