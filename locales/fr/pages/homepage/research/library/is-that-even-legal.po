msgid ""
"All too often, data is extracted and processed far removed from its source, serving the interests of the organizations that collect it rather than the people it impacts. This is why it’s important "
"to explore new ways to govern data: <b>to shift control back to individuals and communities, to strengthen their agency, and to share value</b>. Mozilla is working to change this paradigm."

"Changing this requires system-level change, but opportunities to implement new ideas for better data governance also exist within existing paradigms and legal frameworks. <b>Builders can shape new "
"norms</b> by leveraging opportunities present in existing rules. But to do so, they need a firm understanding of <a id=\"a1\">current realities</a>. This research and the guides we have created for "
"four countries — Germany, India, Kenya, and the United States — aim to help them navigate existing legal landscapes so they can help pave the way for better data governance in the future."
