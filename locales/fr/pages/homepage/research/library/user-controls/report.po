"Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla currently consists of two organizations: the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, which leads our movement building work; and its wholly owned "
"subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation, which leads our market-based work, including the development of the Firefox web browser. The two organizations work in close concert with each other and a global"
" community of tens of thousands of volunteers under the single banner: Mozilla."
