"We chose a research method that reflects the mission of our meaningful AI research, which is to bridge the gap between ongoing, in-depth research on explanatory methods and AI transparency in "
"practice. It is therefore an exploratory action research with a larger scope than usual to also capture trends and evaluate next research and action steps. Rather than focusing on a narrow scope, we"
" used this research to unfold AI transparency to the most extent possible."

"We employed mixed methods research for this project. The survey we conducted was anonymous. We collected quantitative data from multiple choice fields, rankings etc. and qualitative data from open "
"answer fields. We gathered even more qualitative data for our subsequent analysis from the interviews we conducted. We merged data from open fields in the survey and the interview data and then "
"applied a qualitative analysis method on it."

"We reached out to participants through searches on Linkedin, Twitter, Github, external Slack channels, and other resources, and primarily targeted those who indicated they were active in AI "
"transparency or AI assessment on the web. We also asked AI ethics circles and machine learning experts in our network if they knew of colleagues working on AI transparency. In addition, we reached "
"out to startups that offer AI transparency solutions as a service. Look at above to learn more about our participants."
