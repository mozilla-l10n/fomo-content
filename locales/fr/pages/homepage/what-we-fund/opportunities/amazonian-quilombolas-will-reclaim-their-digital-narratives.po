"Digital rights for traditional communities in Brazil are still a major problem of \"double opacity\", a contradiction between knowing that the problem exists, but ignoring its existence and acting "
"as if it did not exist. We have seen private companies like Starlink and the Brazilian government promise to revolutionize connectivity in the Amazônia, but in practice, neither promotes digital "
"inclusion in a durable way."

"By 2025, traditional communities will be working to reclaim their digital rights, intervening where business and government entities have failed. Such as creating the conditions to encourage and "
"guarantee the presence of quilombola people in forums and events on internet governance. Working together with civil society organizations, traditional communities will fight digital divides by "
"implementing community networks and more secure digital services."

"This is a pressing topic because Belem, Brazil – the capital of Pará – will host COP 30 in 2025. We will inform this audience of global climate activists about the existence, strength and "
"sovereignty that is being developed in the Quilombo Oxalá of Jacunday. We will take the opportunity to show relevant data that is omitted by governments, counteracting the Brazilian racism that has "
"hindered access to information about these communities. This builds on the work of civil society organizations, such as Conaq and Bambaê, who have a history of fighting for transparency that "
"supports political advocacy on behalf of Quilombos."

"We know that it is impossible to eliminate the myth of the demographic vacuum; it means that we are a region without people, an empty place with many rivers, a huge forest, a rich biodiversity, but "
"no humans (this thought has existed since colonization). And this is the main blind spot/assumption we will challenge in 2025. The Amazônia is inhabited and cared for by the technologies and "
"knowledge held within traditional communities, whose legacy should serve as a model for appropriating technologies that don't kill their territories."
