"Artificial Intelligence systems are scaling worldwide, bringing a series of socio-political, economic, and regulatory challenges. So far, these challenges have been viewed mainly from the "
"perspective of democracy and human rights implications, but 2025 will herald an irreversible shift. These challenges will increasingly intersect with demands for environmental justice that rebel "
"against the socio-environmental impacts of AI data centers."

"The <a id=\"a1\">AI supply chain</a> relies on creating a globally deployed infrastructure, which has driven the extraction of more minerals, energy, and water in various territories. Data centers "
"have been particularly contentious due to, among other reasons, their rampant consumption of electricity (<a id=\"a2\">which jeopardizes countries' climate goals</a>) and freshwater (<a "
"id=\"a3\">which could lead to disruptions in the global supply chain</a>), as well as its e-waste generation. Some say generative AI adoption <a id=\"a4\">could generate</a> between 1.2 and 5 "
"million metric tons of e-waste in total between now and 2030."

"These potential catastrophes have catalyzed growing resistance to the AI boom, led by diverse communities. Groups in the <a id=\"a1\">United States</a>, <a id=\"a2\">Latin America</a>, and <a "
"id=\"a3\">Europe</a> have opposed the AI-led demand for fresh water in drought-stricken areas. Citizens in <a id=\"a4\">Ireland</a> have raised concerns about the carbon footprint of data centers "
"within its borders. The problem is even more pronounced in countries like <a id=\"a5\">South Africa</a>, where electricity shortages have been a national scandal in recent years, even without AI "
"taxing the grid. Using land and clean energy to deploy these private infrastructures has also been controversial in places as varied as <a id=\"a6\">the Netherlands</a> and <a "
"id=\"a7\">Singapore</a>."

"I study the resistance and responses of territories in Latin America facing sustainability concerns over data centers. And I know 2025 will be a special year: 2024 legislation to temper AI's "
"environmental impact in <a id=\"a1\">the US</a> and <a id=\"a2\">the E</a>U can influence the industry and legislation worldwide. In turn, technology companies and technologists are looking to "
"introduce more <a id=\"a3\">sustainable practices in data centers</a>. Governments, even in the <a id=\"a4\">Global South</a>, are advancing plans to attract AI investment that include "
"sustainability concerns – though <a id=\"a5\">not without controversy</a>. Moreover, <a id=\"a6\">if we can trust the forecastse</a> regarding how data centers will increasingly host advanced AI "
"workloads, we can expect that socio-environmental conflicts will increase, <a id=\"a7\">especially in Latin America</a>, too."

"2025 is thus a key moment to design and deploy better, transparent, and participatory public policies and measures. I will introduce a publicly available tool that systematizes and organizes data on"
" the socio-environmental impacts of AI, the diverse demands it is placing on land, and the successful and unsuccessful responses of companies and local and national governments. I’m particularly "
"interested in the conditions faced by Latin America concerning its position in the supply chain and the unequal power relations in a global scenario that directly impacts the power of territorial "
"communities."

"This work is not a matter of providing recipes or silver bullets for a problem at the heart of 21st-century capitalism. Instead, it is about examining the complexities of digital sustainability amid"
" an ecological and climate crisis, systematizing significant information, increasing its transparency to stakeholders, and advancing responses worthy of the people in affected territories and "
