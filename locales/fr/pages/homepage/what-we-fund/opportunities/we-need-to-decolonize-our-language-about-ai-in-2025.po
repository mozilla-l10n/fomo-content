"Buzz about AI has proliferated in recent years, but the words we use to talk about AI aren't just neutral technical jargon. Instead, language about AI serves as an instrument of power in the fabric "
"of the internet and society. As <a id=\"a1\">M. Hoff</a>, quoting the Bolivian sociologist Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, warns: “[Buzzwords] are words that we take for granted, that silence our worries "
"and concerns and pasteurize our doubts and questions. They are words that, by using them indiscriminately, we weaken them and empty them of their meaning.” When we carelessly employ these buzzwords,"
" we drain them of their significance and power to drive meaningful change."

"The concept of decolonization - of language, of systems, of technology - has become crucial in this context of technological advancement. As AI systems continue to evolve, we're witnessing "
"concerning disconnects between various initiatives that should ideally work in harmony: between AI development and open government, between AI systems and open data practices, and between feminist "
"agendas and public tech policy. These divisions threaten to undermine decolonization efforts and exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly at the intersection of feminism, data, and AI "
"technologies."

"Integrating decolonization principles into AI development serves as a crucial first step - not as a magical solution, but as a practical approach to addressing these challenges. Looking ahead to "
"2025, we can - and must - work toward establishing robust public technology frameworks and associated language that actively support AI decolonization efforts."

"A concrete step in this direction is the implementation of a <a id=\"a1\">gender data collaborative</a> in South America, which forms part of my Mozilla Fellowship work. This initiative aims to "
"strengthen citizen-generated data while bridging the gap between open data initiatives and feminist movements at the grassroots level. However, success in this endeavor requires understanding that "
"feminist technology movements must consider the broader geopolitical landscape of AI development."

"Ultimately, the decolonization of AI transcends mere technological considerations - it represents a fundamental power struggle that encompasses our relationship with technology, our approach to data"
" collection and use, our understanding of knowledge systems, our labor practices, and the political dimensions of our daily lives. By acknowledging and addressing these interconnected challenges, we"
" can work toward an AI future that truly serves and represents all communities."
