"The initial promise of the Internet as an environment for deliberation and consensus is facing a worrying contraction in 2025. During the first decades of the 21st century, digital platforms seemed "
"to promise an agora in which different actors -citizens, journalists, activists, academics- could meet, confront their positions and, sometimes, reach minimum agreements to promote social change. "
"However, the current reality points in the opposite direction. The erosion of open forums and the progressive complexity of accessing verifiable data are weakening the very possibility of building "
"shared consensus."

"Recent examples illustrate this decline. The transformation of Twitter into an increasingly opaque platform dominated by corporate interests, the closure or difficult navigation of transparency "
"portals, and the lack of well-documented and accessible open data repositories have drastically reduced the quality of public debate. Without this infrastructure, critical voices lose reach, "
"information ceases to be a public good and becomes a scarce resource, and discussion becomes fragmented into closed niches. Artificial intelligence, far from fostering connection, threatens to "
"aggravate isolation: models trained on incomplete or biased data and controlled by a few hands can reinforce information bubbles and perpetuate one-sided narratives."

"If this trend continues, 2025 will see online spaces increasingly segmented and controlled by corporate and governmental interests. The absence of common references will limit society's ability to "
"find points of convergence. Without reliable information and virtual venues for horizontal exchange, public deliberation will be further weakened, opening the way to misinformation and digital "
"populism. The civic sphere will be subordinated to mercantile or authoritarian logics, hindering the collective construction of knowledge and proposals for transformation."

"However, the response to this scenario cannot be resignation. We need to react with proactive strategies: betting on open standards, revitalizing free software, and promoting the creation of "
"alternative digital platforms that do not depend exclusively on large funds from the Global North. It is also essential to forge communities capable of sustaining these ecosystems, not only from a "
"technological point of view, but also from an economic and organizational point of view. By opening up data, standardizing its publication and guaranteeing interoperability, we will be able to "
"recompose part of this digital public space. In this way, artificial intelligence and future technological tools can cease to be a burden for consensus and become, instead, an instrument for "
"collaboration, for the collective construction of knowledge, and for the consolidation of a more plural and resilient virtual agora."
