"When something is scary, not many people want to talk about it until it’s too late. But the truth is, we’re already deep in the testing phase of AI and emerging technologies as new recruits of "
"security operations. Soon, these technologies will be officially enlisted not only for weaponization, but for decision making. Globally, the AI race is escalating from a geo-political perspective, "
"and AI weaponization can give a nation power over others in the race and in AI-enabled warfare. In 2025 and beyond, this power can be abused."

"Accepting technologies as they are will only put our nations’ fates in the servers of machines rather than the hands of leaders. In 2025, I foresee dangers in the next applications of unethical AI "
"and unsupervised Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems in the military that is equivalent to the dangers of nuclear power in warfare– because not only are they hazardously scalable, but algorithms and "
"machines are rarely accountable."

"My work with conflict-affected countries in Africa and the Middle East, with migration and in technological advancement in humanitarian situations has taught me that most of the drones, robotics and"
" AI-powered Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (<a id=\"a1\">ISTAR tech</a>) are deployed in these regions, but not developed internally. Africa’s digital economy has "
"long been feeding off of Western AI solutions and robotic technologies to tackle economic, social and geopolitical challenges. However, if we don’t filter the resources and innovation we endorse in "
"our continent and contextualize them with proper policy frameworks, we’ll soon be subject to the same ethical limitations and irresponsible practices that pose risks to safety, privacy and lives. In"
" the encounter between civilian life and military technology, there is a thin line between targeting and profiling – all it takes is one biased machine to make a massive inhumane mistake. In 2025, "
"we have to assess its accessibility, monitor its development and maintain unbiased governance of its deployment in these operations."
