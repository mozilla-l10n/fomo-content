"<a id=\"a1\">CrushOn.AI</a>'s brand of AI chat companions are animated characters. You can even design your own! A quick browse through their catalog shows that art imitates life though since you'll"
" see some familiar faces. That means if you've ever longed for a spicy chat with Sailor Moon, Sonic the Hedgehog, Ghostface (from the Scream movies), or a muscular man with a pyramid for a head, "
"your long wait is over. Unfortunately, before you can let those DMs fly you'll have to navigate a very confusing and sketchy web of websites that make it pretty much impossible to figure out what is"
" legitimate. There's its empty App Store page, a fake chatbot competitor's page that links to CrushOn instead, and a \"CrushOn pro\" page that links to a totally different NSFW chatbot. Then there's"
" the fact that its Google Play Store page links to Apple's user agreement instead of their own. Huh? All that plus three dings from us and creepy content upfront means *Privacy (definitely) Not "

"That head spinning feeling we got from doing a little digging into CrushOn? A deeper dive did not help. CrushOn'sp <a id=\"a1\">Privacy Policy</a> shows they collect some really sensitive data -- "
"including information about your mental and physical health -- and can share it or use it for their own business and commercial purposes. When they're not giving it away, we’re worried your data "
"could be breached since we can't confirm CrushOn meets our Minimum Security Standards."

"Another thing: CrushOn’s chatbots seem like they're set up to violate the app’s terms and community standards. So we can’t help but wonder who will be held responsible if your conversation goes into"

"Here's something we think all users should know before they fire up CrushOn. It looks like there's a huge gap between the fine print of the <a id=\"a1\">Community Guidelines</a> and <a "
"id=\"a2\">Terms of Use</a> and what seems to be really going on on the app and website. On the first page of their NSFW AI chat partners on its website, CrushOn shows characters with images and "
"descriptions that suggest <i>*disturbing things*</i>. But many of those <i>*disturbing things*</i> are explicitly against CrushOn’s community guidelines. And then when you open a chat, there’s a "
"little disclaimer that says <i>“Everything AI says is made up! Please follow your local laws. You are not allowed to chat about underage, suicide, or criminal topics.”</i> But right below that "
"there’s a character intro paragraph that sometimes includes descriptions of those off-limits topics right off the bat. It's confusing, feels misleading, and, coupled with the mouse-trap maze of real"
" and fake websites associated with CrushOn, makes us question whether this service can be trusted with sensitive information at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"And that's worrisome because CrushOn can collect a LOT of sensitive personal information about you. Aside from account information like your contact and financial information, CrushOn can collect "
"audio and visual data (like voicemails and other recordings), information about your device or browser (like IP address), location data, and identity data (like your race, ethnicity, age, and "
"gender) and biometric data (like images of your face, keystroke patterns, and recordings of your voice). Yikes! CrushOn can also collect a surprising amount of health data. Really. <b><i>\"Health "
"data\"</i></b><b> is mentioned 23 times in the privacy policy. That information can include \"Individual health conditions, treatment, diseases, or diagnosis; Social, psychological, behavioral, and "
"medical interventions; Use of prescribed medication; Gender-affirming care information; Reproductive or sexual health information;\" and more.</b> What on earth? At this rate, CrushOn could know "
"more about you than your real life loved ones."

"How do they even get that information? Let us count the ways. The <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> lists chats and character creation as a source of personal and health information. It also says both"
" can be used to “<i>train AI models”</i> and for that vague catch all, <i>“Business Purposes”.</i> We do not like the sound of that. CrushOn can also collect personal data automatically from your "
"device and from third parties (like social media and service providers). And CrushOn can use all those kinds of personal information for <i>“Commercial Purposes''</i> which includes ads and "
"marketing according to the privacy policy. Wow! It’s weird that CrushOn’s privacy policy seems to understand that your NSFW chats might have really sensitive information in them but doesn't seem to "
"treat that data differently in any way. That’s a bold move, CrushOn. Oh and did we mention that CrushOn can <i>“create and infer”</i> data about you, based on what else they know about you? Those "
"can be used for <i>“Commercial Purposes”</i> and <i>“Business Purposes”</i> too."

"Not gonna lie, this all painting a really bad picture for the privacy of CrushOn. But we also have some security concerns. We can't determine whether any of this super sensitive information is "
"encrypted and whether CrushOn has a way of managing security vulnerabilities. That’s scary because it means there’s a much bigger risk that your information could be leaked by mistake or breached by"
" bad actors. And on the topic of other parties getting access to your data, CrushOn also says they can share your personal information (potentially including that health information!) with third "
"parties (like vendors, service providers, and for “Legal Disclosure”) and with affiliates (like their parent company Peekaboo Tech Inc. also Peekaboo Tech Ltd. and Peekaboo Game Ltd.). That’s a heck"

"All this opens up a can of worries. We're worried (just like CrushOn seems to be) that humans could take the disturbing things the chatbots might say to heart. And we're worried about what the "
"chatbots might say in the first place -- especially to minors. Which brings us to another worry. Yes the privacy policy says users have to be over 18, but all users have to do to \"prove\" they are "
"is check a box. And like we mentioned earlier, we're worried about who will be left holding the bag if your chat goes off the rails from what's technically allowed by the Community Guidelines (which"
" you implicitly agree to as part of the Terms of Use). Because, the thing is, even though the terms say that you give CrushOn permission to use (or \"<i>reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative "
"works of, display, publish, broadcast, perform, make, use, import, offer to sell, sell...\"</i>) the content you submit, ultimately you are still <i>\"solely responsible for Your own User "
"Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them\".</i>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"

"And \"CrushOn will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing CrushOn to disclose the identity of anyone violating these [terms of use].\". There is "
"also a lot of talk in those terms about CrushOn not being legally responsible if anything bad happens as a result of you using the service. Specifically, it says <i>\"IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CRUSHON "
"PARTIES, APPLE, OR GOOGLE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM THE SERVICE\".</i> And that,"
" well, yeah that worries us too because sometimes bad things do happen as a result of romantic AI chatbot conversations."

"What's the worst that could happen with CrushOn? We're worried that the DIY-nature of the CrushOn's romantic AI chatbots might encourage users to let their freak flags fly --- which, don't get us "

"concerned doesn't have the best privacy, security, and AI transparency practices. Meaning, all those chats you had with Pyramid Head Guy that detail your desire to raid King Tut's Tomb naked could "
