"Netatmo’s HD video indoor security cameras come with a cool smart face recognition feature that lets you tell which faces Netatmo should know, like Grandma or your neighbor, and allow you to tell "
"the camera to not record when it sees these faces. That’s a pretty cool privacy feature. And then these cameras can tell you when it doesn’t recognize a face and send you an alert, like when a "
"burglar breaks into your home. That’s all cool stuff. Netatmo also doesn’t record video to the Cloud, which is another great privacy feature. All video is recorded locally on an encrypted MicroSD "
"card. You have the option to save it to Dropbox if you want. Good work Netatmo, we’re impressed."

"We love that Netatmo offers only local storage on a MicroSD card as that’s generally a much safer way to save your video than storing it in the Cloud. And because Netatmo is headquartered in France,"
" it appears their privacy policy applies Europe’s stricter <a id=\"a1\">GDPR privacy regulations</a> to all their data collection, which is great for users. They don’t sell data. They are very "
"cautious about who they share data with."

"We love that Netatmo seems to take privacy and security seriously. It’s a great thing to see from makers of security cameras. What’s the worst that could happen? Well, we suppose your camera could "

"things that could happen."
