"Raya has a reputation as a secret, exclusive club for members only. Basically, it wants you to think it's where all the cool kids are. To join, it seems users must get invited by someone already on "
"the app and fill out an application that includes your Instagram account (you've got to have at least thousands of followers), your contacts, and your education level. That application is reviewed "
"by a committee and an \"evolving\" algorithm to determine if you make it into the club. Launched in 2015, and rumored to be a celebrity dating app, Raya has since expanded to include a professional "
"networking function for people in the entertainment world. Anyone can apply for membership to Raya, although according to Wikipedia, the acceptance rate is reportedly only about eight percent. Oh, "
"and Raya can only be accessed through the app and is for iOS users only, Android users need not apply."

"Being a super secret, \"celebrity\" dating app means that Raya claims to make users' privacy and confidentiality a top priority. The application process people who want to join Raya must go through "
"sounds a bit invasive as a committee digs into your contacts, Instagram, education, and more to see if you're cool enough to join the club. Once invited to join though, does Raya do a good job of "
"protecting their users' privacy? It's a little hard for us to tell, they are super secret after all. They don't sell any user data they collect, which is a good thing. They do share aggregated, "
"anonymized data with third parties like investors for business purposes, which isn't too uncommon, although we do like to warn that often this data isn't too hard do de-anonymize. As we're not part "
"of the club and they didn't respond to our emails, we couldn't tell if they require a strong password to protect the app, if they use encryptions on chats and messages within the app, or what sorts "
"of data their \"evolving algorithm\" might use to evaluate applications. What could happen if something goes wrong? Hard to tell. We suppose you could get accepted into the Raya club, end up have a "
"weird chat with Pete Davidson, and have no proof because Raya really frowns on screenshots within the app."
