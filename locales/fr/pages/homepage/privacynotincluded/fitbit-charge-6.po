"Fitbit's new in 2023 Charge 6 comes with all the fitness tracking goodies you're used to: GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress managing, stairs climbed, calories burned, "

"like your profile photo, period tracking information, and even snore detection data if you pay a premium. Tempting! Google can also collect the data that your Fitbit creates about you: your steps, "

"The second big concern we have about Google is their track record at being honest and respecting all this personal information they collect on us. Google has racked up quite a long list of fines for"

"id=\"a2\">$5 billion lawsuit was allowed to continue</a> against Google for secretly tracking users internet use when the judge ruled \"she could not find that users consented to letting Google "

"Google $57 million for \"\"failing to acknowledge how its users' data is processed.\"\" Those are just the fines and lawsuits that have happened since we last reviewed Google in 2022. Over the past "
