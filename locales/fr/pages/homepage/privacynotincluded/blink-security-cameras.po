"Amazon's other line of security cameras, they also own Ring, are these indoor and outdoor Blink security cams. They tend to be cheaper than Ring cameras, they offer local storage (yay!), come in a "
"mini-cam, an indoor cam, an outdoor cam, and a floodlight cam, and feature all the usual: HD video, two-way audio, motion detection and night vision. It's Amazon, so of course these work with Alexa."
" You can keep on eye on everything with the Blink Home Monitor app on your phone. As they say on their website, \"Blink and you're home,\" which, honestly, I have no idea what that means."

"Blink was acquired by Amazon in December, 2017. Amazon's other security camera maker, Ring, has had a <a id=\"a1\">plethora of privacy and security issues</a> they've had to deal with over the past "
"couple years. Blink is not Ring. Blink cameras don't easily work on the Ring Neighbors app that has raised concerns for us around public safety and racism. You can manually upload a Blink video to "
"the Neighbors app, but you can do that with any video. And these Blink cameras have a local storage option that means you aren’t required to store your video in the Cloud to access it, which is a "
"much better privacy option."
