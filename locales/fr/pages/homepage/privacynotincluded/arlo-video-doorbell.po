"If you're one of those people who run and hide in the closet when a stranger knocks on your door, these video doorbells from Arlo (or any video doorbell, really) are for you! Check the HD video with"
" night vision and 180 degree viewing angle to see if there's a crazy guy with a hatchet at your front door. If there is, use the two-way audio to let him know you've called the cops. Get a phone "
"alert when the motion sensor trips as he creeps around again. Then blast the built-in siren on the doorbell from your phone to scare hatchet guy away for good. Just one real-world scenario of how "

"First, the good stuff. We first fell in love with Arlo back on International Privacy Day in 2019 when they proudly <a id=\"a1\">proclaimed</a> they will not share or sell or monetize their users' "
"data in any way. It was a bit of a dig at Amazon’s Ring--who was in the midst of dealing with a number of public privacy concerns. We'll take some trolling of Ring to get great user privacy "
"protections from Arlo. Arlo also has a very nice page where they <a id=\"a2\">lay out clearly how, when, and why they will share data with law enforcement</a> and governments. This is super nice to "
"see because companies like Amazon Ring have such a close relationship with law enforcement and sharing of video it leaves us very concerned. Arlo does much better, clearly stating they will only "
"share your video and personal information with law enforcement through a valid legal process and even then they say they will limit what they share as much as possible. This is what we like to see! "

"hate for them to gather a bunch of data on you and infer that your attitude is ripe for fear and use that to try and sell you a bunch more cameras and video monitoring services that you might not "
