"controlling music are no longer sent over the internet to their servers, instead they are processed directly on the HomePod. And any information used to personalize things for you across your Apple "
"devices is synced over iCloud using end-to-end encryption. All this is good for your privacy. Apple did <a id=\"a3\">face backlash</a> in 2019 when it came to light their contractors were regularly "
