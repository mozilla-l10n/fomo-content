"Door knockers are cool, but so old-fashioned. Door bells are neat, but so analog. Welcome to 24-hour surveillance on your doorstep. Calling these video doorbells from Google — there's a wired one "
"and battery powered one — a doorbell is a bit misleading. They are HD-video, two-way audio, motion sensing, infrared night vision, 24/7 streaming devices that lets you see, hear, and speak to people"
" at your door from your phone or computer. Get alerts to let you know when a package is delivered, an animal is creeping about, or if your annoying neighbor is at the door. These video doorbells "
"even let your pre-recorded messages so you can tell that annoying neighbor you're not home, even if you are. You'll need an additional Nest Aware subscription for some features, including 10 days of"

"Google seems to do a better job than some of the other Big Tech companies when it comes to security and privacy. That said, you should be aware they are a huge ad company that needs your data to "
"sell ads. So while they say video and audio recordings won't be used to target you with ads, transcripts of your voice interactions may. Google uses your personal information to show you ads all "

"We do like that users are now automatically opted out of Google's human review of voice recordings, because that was super creepy. We also like that Google does try to communicate with users how "
