"Pregnancy+ is made by UK-based company Philips Digital. They also make an app called Baby+. Both apps share the same privacy policy. Pregnancy+ seems to have tens of millions of downloads from the "
"Google and Apple apps store, making it one of the more popular pregnancy apps out there. The app — free for the first 13 weeks — requires a subscription to get your through your entire pregnancy. "
"The apps helps you track baby development using visualizations of fruits, animals, and sweets (uhm, like, your baby is the size of a cookie now, not the size of a cupcake?). It also has pregnancy "
"tools like a due date calculator, kick counter, pregnancy weight log, and gives you lots of pregnancy guides, articles, blog posts, and even helps you create a custom birth plan. The app has lots of"
" ways to collect lots of information about you throughout your pregnancy. So, how does it do protecting all that very personal information. Eh, that's not so sweet."

"Gold or Silver? That's the question Pregnancy+ asks users at sign up. Which \"experience\" would you like? Then they push you hard to pick Gold by saying Gold is \"the best possible experience with "
"a customized journey and advertisement that is relevant for you.\" What that really means is that if you pick Gold, they'll track you not only with cookies, but also with your advertising ID so they"
" can learn more about you, target ads toward you based on your interests and preferences, and share even more of your personal data with the likes of Facebook and Google. Pick Silver, people!"

"So, yeah, Pregnancy+ does collect a whole lot of personal and sensitive information on you. Things like name, age, location, weight, baby's gender, due date, pictures of your belly, what's on your "
"pregnancy shopping list, and so much more if you chose to share things like doctor's notes and favorite baby names. And, as you can already tell, it uses some of your personal information to have "
"third-parties target you with ads. Pregnancy+ also shares data with more than just third-party advertisers. They also say they can share your personal information with external media partners like "
"Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest for ad purposes and they can share your information with lots of business partners for marketing purposes. They say, \"By selecting one or multiple partners and "
"tapping 'Sign-up!' you are authorizing and instructing Philips to share your contact details (email, first name, last name), due date, mobile device information (country, locale and operating "
"system) and authorization (consent text and date) with the selected partners to receive personalized offers from them in accordance with your choices.\""

"Pregnancy+ collects a lot of personal information, asks to share a good deal of this information for targeted advertising and marketing purposes, and even combines all your data to create a pretty "

"And then there is the question so important in the post Roe vs Wade world in the United States. What and how does Pregnancy+ share your personal information with law enforcement and the government? "
"Well, here's the vague statement addressing that we found in their privacy policy, \"When required by law, or as necessary to protect our rights, we may share your data with public and governmental "
"authorities.\" That doesn't tell us much. We'd love to see a clearer statement about how they handle data sharing with law enforcement."

"What's the worst that could happen? Well, with the huge amount of personal and sensitive information Pregnancy+ can collect on you, combined with other data they collect and use to target you with "
"ads and personalization, the worst that could happen could probably include you losing your privacy during your pregnancy. And with their vague statement about what and when they might share "
"information with \"public and governmental authorities\" including law enforcement, well, yikes! That could go south very quickly. So, we'll leave you with advice from Pregnancy+ privacy policy that"
" actually sounds good to us, \"If you do not want us to collect and process your personal data, you may not be able to use the Services.\" Yeah, maybe not using their services is your best bet if "
"you care about privacy."
