"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. They have had some serious security issues, including <a id=\"a1\">one in 2022</a> that could allow hackers to take complete "

"When it comes to AI voice assistants, Siri is a bit more privacy conscious than others like Amazon’s Alexa. Apple says <a id=\"a1\">they take special care</a> to make sure your Siri requests aren't "

"controlling music are no longer sent over the internet to their servers, instead they are processed directly on the HomePod. And any information used to personalize things for you across your Apple "
"devices is synced over iCloud using end-to-end encryption. All this is good for your privacy. Apple did <a id=\"a3\">face backlash</a> in 2019 when it came to light their contractors were regularly "

"So, while Apple is pretty good now, there is no guarantee that Apple won’t reorganize their business or change their privacy practices in the future. Then that personal information you trust them "
