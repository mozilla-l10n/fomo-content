"Not gonna lie, it sure seems Samsung likes to collect a lot of data on users, young and old alike (seriously, <a id=\"a1\">the children's data section</a> in their Samsung account privacy policy "

"geolocation, browsing history, the super-broad “sensory information” and information that you store on your device like your photos, contacts, text logs, and calendar information. Oh my! And that’s "
"on top of the standard account information most companies collect, like your contact and payment information. They can also create “inferences” about you -- which are assumptions about your "
