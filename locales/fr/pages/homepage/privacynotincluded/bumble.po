"Every dating app has a thing. Bumble's thing is only women can make the first move in the app to contact a man (for users looking for someone of the same gender, anyone can make the first move). "
"Bumble says their goal is to shake up the gender norms and empower women to make the first move. Which can be a breath of fresh air in the straight dating app world where women are constantly "
"bombarded with \"Hey\" as an opening line (come on guys, do better!). Founded by a former Tinder employee and launched in 2014, Bumble now has millions of users worldwide and has even branched out "
"with new apps that help you network (Bumble Bizz) or meet new friends (Bumble BFF). This dating app lets users sign up with Facebook or their phone number (they added the phone number options back "
"in 2018 following Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal). All profile information on Bumble is public, so if you sign up with Facebook be aware it could pull your personal info from there and make "
"it open to all users. How is Bumble at privacy? Well, not great TBH."

"Bumble says they want to provide a safe dating space, especially for women. They even use <a id=\"a1\">artificial intelligence</a> to <a id=\"a2\">moderate</a> harmful text and automatically blur "
"lewd photos. Good for them! Unfortunately, they have some work to do to provide a safe space for your personal data. Back in 2020, researchers <a id=\"a3\">found</a> a security bug in Bumble that "
"exposed the personal information of their nearly 100M users. All that really personal info, like political leanings, weight, the type of person a user was looking for, and even location were open to"
" any attacker with a little technical know how. Then in 2021, a security researcher <a id=\"a4\">reported</a> a vulnerability that could have let an attacker see users' precise location. We'll say "
"it again, no matter what a company's privacy policy says, any personal information you share with them online is potentially vulnerable and could be used by bad people for bad purposes. Oh and in "
"2023, Bumble was also the subject of a class action suit <a id=\"a5\">that claimed</a> the app collects biometric data without getting proper consent. Not the greatest track record there Bumble."

"Breaches and hacks aren't uncommon in the dating app space, but that doesn't make them any less worrisome to us. Especially because these dating apps can collect so much sensitive personal "
"information -- like your sexual preference, birthday, and location. That's on top of standard account information like your email address, name, and phone number. Bumble can also collect your "
"biometric information if you use <a id=\"a1\">Photo Verification</a>. And you should know that just sharing any of that information counts as \"explicitly consenting\" to Bumble's processing of it. "
"Interesting. Then there's all the photos and text you add to your profile, including the answers to some of Bumble's adorable prompts. Things like <i>\"you're really nerdy about\"</i> [our answer: "
"data privacy!] or that <i>\"if you were president\"</i> you would [our answer: enact the world's strongest privacy law!]. Bumble's privacy policy does <a id=\"a2\">warn</a> users that <i>\"you "
"should assume that anything you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users of the App.\"</i> Okay then, good advice. Other things that might be "
"seen: your DMs! Bumble says they review the content of messages to moderate them but also to \"<i>identify topics, sentiments, and trends across our Users.\"</i> They say they take \"<i>steps to "
"remove personally identifying information from such messages, prior to reviewing them.\"</i> We'll just have to trust them on that."

"What else? If you decide to login to Bumble using Facebook, you authorize them to access a lot of personal information from Facebook unless you opt out -- like your birthday, profile photos, and "
"Page likes. So please remember, when you connect a social media account like Facebook to Bumble, both Facebook and Bumble now potentially collect more information together. That's why we recommend "
"users don't link your dating app to Facebook, use your phone number instead. Because really, you don't need to share all your personal info with Facebook, and then Bumble, and then Bumble may share "
"more with Facebook and then it all gets exposed and soon the world knows where you live, who you think is hot, and how much money you make. That might be a recipe for a good date... it's also "
"potentially a recipe for disaster. We're so glad using Facebook to login is <a id=\"a1\">no longer a requirement</a> on Bumble since back in 2018. Good call, Bumble."

"reasons that won't help you meet new empowering people, like to show you targeted ads on the app. They can also share your personal information with marketing service providers to show you ads on "
"third party websites. Hmm. Does that mean Bumble can sell your data? Well, they do have a pop-up window that says <i>\"We use services that help improve marketing campaigns. ... Under certain "
"privacy laws, this may be considered selling or sharing your personal information with our marketing partners,\"</i> and then gives you the option to opt out of the selling of your data. So, yeah, "

"Bumbling? Well, we can look to Bumble's own track record for inspiration: a security vulnerability exposing your exact location, your weight, and your political leanings to the world without your "
