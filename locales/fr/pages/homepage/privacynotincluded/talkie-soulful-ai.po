"Talkie Soulful AI is an AI chatbot that lets you <i>\"craft your AI buddy from scratch\"</i> with an AI that <i>\"goes beyond conversation, capturing and sharing moments through pictures with a "
"unique visual flair\"</i> so you can \"<i>create cherished memories you can relive anytime.\"</i> We're not really sure about all that, but we do know that we found some pretty sketchy content on "
"Talkie Soulful AI. You'll have to pay about $10 a month to access all the \"<i>diverse AI personas\"</i> Talkie has to offer. How about your privacy, should you trust Talkie with that? Yeah, that's "
"probably not a good idea at all."

"Talkie Soulful AI calls their app a <i>\"self-help program.\"</i> Which, given how much and how easily we were able to find some pretty disturbing content right from the search function in their "
"app, we're really concerned about this app claiming it's there for \"self-help.\" This might not be a privacy issue exactly, but it is a reoccurring issue we found with many of the AI relationship "
"chatbots we reviewed. We found too many apps that positioned themselves as self-help, wellness, or mental health AI chatbot apps that contained tons of icky, sketchy, and sometimes downright scary "
"content (think rape, abuse, and underage themes). Just be careful out there!"

"On the privacy front, Talkie Soulful AI worries us a lot. They say they can sell and share you personal information for targeted advertising purposes. That's <i>not</i> good. They do say they won't "
"use the contents of your messages through the app for targeted advertising, which is good. Talkie's <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> indicates that not all users have the same rights to have their "
"data deleted if they want to. That's also<i> not</i> good. And we couldn't confirm if Talkie meets our Minimum Security Standards. All of this leads us to warn users that Talkie could come with "
"*Privacy Not Included."

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"And then there are our questions and concerns about Talkie Soulful AI's AI models. While it is good that Talkie says they won't use the content of your messages with their AI chatbots for targeted "
"advertising purposes, we couldn't find any very clear mentions of how they can use the content of those messages to train their AIs. They do say they can aggregate, anonymize, and de-identify your "
"messages, content, interests, and preferences to analyze trends in the use of Talkie's services. This is pretty common, however, our concern hear lies with how well the de-identify and anonymize all"
" that personal information you share about yourself. We always worry about this as <a id=\"a1\">it's been found to be relatively easy to re-identify de-identified personal information</a> so just "
"beware before you overshare too many personal details with your favorite AI chatbot (on any service or platform, not just Talkie's)."

"There's also this link in Talkie Soulful AI's <a id=\"a1\">Terms of Service</a> that seems to grant them pretty broad permissions to use the content you submit through their app, <i>\"By uploading "

"feel pretty broad and worrisome to us."

"Finally, we found no way for users to control or understand how the AI chatbots they interact with on Talkie's app work. This worries us because if you don't know how the AI chatbot works or have "
"any control of it, then what's to prevent it from developing a relationship with you and then become abusive or manipulative? This is a concern we have with all AI chatbots and why we want to see "
"more transparency and user-control in them. Shoot, even Talkie admits in their Terms of Service that, <i>\"The Services are based on rapidly evolving fields of AI and machine learning. You "
"acknowledge that our outputs may contain inaccuracies or errors. You are responsible for evaluating the accuracy of outputs for your use case.\"</i> So, basically, trust nothing and assume nothing "
"when interacting with your \"self-help\" Talkie AI chatbot."

msgid ""
"What's the worst that could happen with Talkie Soulful AI? We're really worried that an app that bills itself as a <i>\"self-help program\"</i> contains so much easily accessible, disturbing "
"content. If some lonely soul downloaded Talkie Soulful AI looking for a friend to help them feel better and instead ended up talking with harmful AI chatbots that made them feel worse, lots of bad "
"things could go wrong. We do worry about the potential impact AI models with so little transparency, control, and potential for harmful content could have on vulnerable users mental or physical "
"health. Apps that bill themselves as \"<i>self-help programs</i>\" should absolutely do better."
