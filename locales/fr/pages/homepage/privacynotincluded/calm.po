"\"Take a deep breath\" Those are the first words you see when you open this meditation app. Then you hear the soothing sounds of rain in the forest or waves at beach. Ahh...feeling calmer already. "
"Calm is a popular app to meditate, relax, and help you fall asleep. Your stressed out privacy researcher here at <i>*Privacy Not Included</i> has actually relied on it for a number of years to help "
"keep the anxiety of reading all these privacy policies at bay. Unfortunately, this researcher didn't actually read their privacy policy until doing our research for these mental health apps."

"Dang it! Calm's privacy policy now has us all stressed out. Seems not only do they collect a pretty good amount of personal information, they also gather data from outside sources, and use lots of "
"tracking and data collect to target ads and share information with a number of third parties for things like marketing and research. That's rather stressful. This privacy researcher is gonna go take"
" a few more deep breaths...on my own, with no app collecting my data."

"Uhg...Calm, why oh why must you ruin our zen meditation vibe with stressful privacy practices? You know what's rather stressful? When a company says, \"<i>Calm uses your data to personalize your "
"online experience and the advertisements you see on other platforms based on your preferences, interests, and browsing behavior.</i>\" OK, so, there are certainly more stressful things in life. But "
"still, what if we just want to meditate in peace without all our data being used to find ways to sell us more stuff or keep us on the app longer? Pardon us as we go take another deep breath."

"companies, nope, these are not calming <a id=\"a4\">privacy practices</a> at all. Then there's this (unfortunately) common practice where they say they \"<i>also share aggregated or other "
"information not subject to obligations under the data protection laws of your jurisdiction with third parties</i>.\" Here's where we have to remind you that it's been found to be <a "

"What's the worst that could happen? Well, could Calm get to know all about your meditation practices, your mood, your gender, you location, and more. Then use or share that information to target you"
" with ads about things, like a wine company thinking you're ripe for targeting with wine ads when you're using the app a lot because that might mean you're stressed out. But you're a recovering "
"alcoholic and the wine ads add to your stress. It's just one potential scenario of how targeted ads based on on your behavior and identifiers on the app could go wrong. Not something any of us need "
"when we just want to meditate in peace, dang it!"
