"standards like Netflix and Disney+ and rent or buy movies as well. You'll also get a free three month subscription to Apple TV+, Apple's own streaming service (it's $4.99 per month after the free "

"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. They have had some serious security issues, including <a id=\"a1\">one in 2022</a> that could allow hackers to take complete "
"control of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. And another bad <a id=\"a2\">security vulnerability</a> that resulted in spyware that could allow bad actors to record calls and messages and even turn the "
"device camera and microphone on without the user knowing. The good thing with Apple and security is, they seem to take these security breaches seriously, jump and fix them immediately, and "
"communicate pretty well with users on what they need to do to stay safe. So keep those devices updated folks! And take those security warnings seriously when you get them. This is also a good "

"When it comes to AI voice assistants, Siri is a bit more privacy conscious than others like Amazon‚Äôs Alexa. Apple says <a id=\"a1\">they take special care</a> to make sure your Siri requests aren't "

"controlling music are no longer sent over the internet to their servers, instead they are processed directly on the HomePod. And any information used to personalize things for you across your Apple "
"devices is synced over iCloud using end-to-end encryption. All this is good for your privacy. Apple did <a id=\"a3\">face backlash</a> in 2019 when it came to light their contractors were regularly "
