"Lovoo, the app with a heart, was one of Germany's first apps back in 2011. Today, it's popular in Austria, Switzerland, France, Spain, and Italy too. The app lets users choose from a bunch of "
"different ways to connect once you set up a profile. The app does have your run-of-the-mill swiping, of course. But there's also match recommendations called CherryPicks, an explore page that shows "
"users near you, and something you don't see every day: live speed dating! Lovoo is free to join but offers lots of benefits to premium users, like an ad-free experience, incognito mode, unlimited "
"swipes, and more. If you want to date, flirt, make new friends, or fall in love, Lovoo says they're here to guide you. Is Lovoo guidance just what you need? Who knows! It's hard to argue with a "
"reported 35 million matches per month."

"It turns out, the app with a heart, Lovoo, is also the app without a privacy policy. Yikes! We did find one <a id=\"a1\">in German</a>. And that's cool for people who understand German, but the app "
"is available for download in areas where most of the population doesn't -- like the United States, Canada, and the UK. Also, their website and Google Play and App Store content is available in "
"English, so it's more than a little worrisome that the privacy policy didn't make the cut. No privacy policy? No privacy promises! So we're worried Lovoo could come with *Privacy Not Included."

"It's very bad when an app that can collect a whole bunch of detailed personal information about its users (like most dating apps do) makes no effort to let them know how that information will be "
"handled. The fact that it's missing is a red flag all on its own but it leaves us without answers to even basic privacy questions. Like what information does the app collect in the first place? Ugh."
" We're also curious to check in on whether Lovoo has made any changes to address claims of <a id=\"a1\">deceptive behavior</a> and <a id=\"a2\">safety concerns</a> about location-tracking, from way "
"back in 2016 and 2019."

"All in all, we're speechless when it comes to Lovoo and what could go wrong. What we can say is that you should stay far, far away from a dating app that doesn't take the time to put the privacy "
"policy in the same language they allow you to download the app. Oh and while you're here, you should beware of <a id=\"a1\">romance scams</a> if you're looking for love online. They're a risk not "
"just with Lovoo, but all dating apps."
