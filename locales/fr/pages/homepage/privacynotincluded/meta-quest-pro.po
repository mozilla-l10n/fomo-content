"Got an extra $1,500 lying around to dump on Mark Zuckerberg's high-end metaverse delivering headset? (we don't) Billed by Meta nee Facebook as \"a whole new way to work, create, and collaborate,' "
"the Meta Quest Pro seems to be targeted more at the business set that the average gamer or consumer set. With things like \"high resolution mixed reality\" and \"authentic avatar expressions,\" Meta"

"Now Meta has come out with the Quest Pro, their high-end VR/AR headset designed to deliver the metaverse (with or without legs) to your face. This expensive gadget also delivers a whole lot of "
