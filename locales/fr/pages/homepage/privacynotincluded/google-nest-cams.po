"Surveillance cameras are everywhere these days. If you want to jump on the bandwagon, Google's indoor and outdoor Nest Cams offers HD video, 24/7 recording, alert you when they detect motion, have "
"multiple microphone for detecting loud noises, and intelligent alerts can tell a person from a thing and then alert you so can yell at the person, not the thing. Which is either handy when it comes "
"to chasing away bad guys, or tons of fun when it comes to scaring the pants off that buddy who’s looking after your cat."
