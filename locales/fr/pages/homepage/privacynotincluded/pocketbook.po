"Pocketbook, founded in Kyiv, Ukraine in 2007 and then shifted its headquarters to Switzerland in 2012, makes a wide range of eReaders based on E Ink technology. There are color ones, big ones, "
"little ones, waterproof ones, and touchscreen ones. Pocketbook eReaders support a number of different eReader formats so you’re not tied to Amazon for your books. And the color ones are <a "

"What’s this?!? Pocketbook says they do not collect any personal identity information on their users. What year is this, 1921? Seriously, there’s a company out there that doesn’t collect your "
"personal information? Which means they can’t share it either, because they don’t collect it. They do say they collect technical and usage data. And they say they use that usage data to give you "
"personal recommendations. All that seems ok though. The only qualm we have with Pocketbook is it seems their privacy policy was last updated in 2018. Buy hey, if they aren’t collecting much data on "
"you at all, maybe that’s ok. Doesn’t seem too much could go wrong with these eReaders, other than you might get addicted to reading comic books. Go for it, we say!"
