"The good thing about Facebook Dating is it's one of the few completely free dating apps out there. The bad thing about Facebook Dating is that it's Facebook, which has a terrible track record at "
"protecting their users' privacy and personal information. So, what do you get with Facebook's free dating service, questionable privacy practices aside? You use Facebook Dating, launched in 2019, "
"through your existing Facebook app, no need to install a new app (warning though, the Facebook app collects a lot of data on you if you chose to install it). Create a dating profile in the Facebook "
"app and away you go. Facebook uses all the data it has on you (which is a lot) to find matches for you based on what you like, which events you've attended and which groups you're apart of. With "
"Facebook Dating's Secret Crush feature, you can anonymously reach out to your crush (if they're on Facebook or Instagram) to see if they like you too. Cute! But is it worth giving Facebook and Meta "
"even more of your personal data? Probably not."

"Not to be dramatic, but Facebook and dating is a match made in privacy hell. You probably already know why but let's get into it anyway. Meta (you know, the company that used to be Facebook), has a "
"very <a id=\"a1\">long history</a> of betraying users' privacy and trust. They've faced <a id=\"a2\">record fines</a> around <a id=\"a3\">the world</a> for this and have been <a id=\"a4\">caught "
"hiding</a> data leaks from their users. In 2023 alone, Meta was <a id=\"a5\">fined</a> another record-breaking 1.2B Euros for violating Europe’s GDPR. They were <a id=\"a6\">sued</a> by 41 US states"
" for “ensnar[ing] youth and teens [...] to maximize its financial gains”. And they were fined millions by <a id=\"a7\">Norwegian</a> and <a id=\"a8\">European</a> regulators for their handling of "
"data for targeted advertising. Even though that’s all really terrible, it’s not that unusual for Meta. In 2022, they were <a id=\"a9\">fined $400m</a> for the treatment of children’s data on "
"Instagram and were involved in a <a id=\"a10\">data breach</a> impacting 3 million patients of a healthcare center in the US. Then there was the <a id=\"a11\">admission</a> that over one million "
"Facebook users’ login info may have been compromised due to malicious apps stealing data through the Facebook third-party login (hey, Meta/Facebook did announce this themselves, so, good for them). "
"Just to name a few of their recent hits. Then add all that to the <a id=\"a12\">Facebook whistleblower testimony</a> in 2021 to the US Congress that outlined the harms Meta/Facebook causes and the "
"<a id=\"a13\">dishonest way</a> they approach dealing with these harms and Meta/Facebook appears to be one of most immoral companies we review in *Privacy Not Included."

"So, yeah, the biggest red flag privacy-wise for Facebook Dating is that you have to have a Facebook account. And turning on Facebook Dating in your account means that Meta can assume you agree to <a"
" id=\"a1\">Facebook Dating's Supplemental Privacy Policy</a> on top of Facebook's regular privacy policy -- which is a <a id=\"a2\">doozy</a>. To do so, you have to give Facebook your gender and the"
" gender you're interested in. So just know that they can use that information and other sensitive information about you that you might give for matching -- like your religion -- to \"Improve the "
"Dating experience.\" It's not totally clear what that means but probably that Facebook can use your sensitive personal information for their own research. They say they won't use that information to"

"\"like,\" anyone you match or connect with, groups you belong to, Facebook pages you visit... You get the idea. Aside from the information you put in your profile and how you act on the app, "
"Facebook collects a bunch of data automatically from your device. That includes location-related <a id=\"a1\">information</a> \"even if Location Services is turned off in your device settings,\" "
"your phone's battery level (for some reason), <a id=\"a2\">and</a> \"[a]pp files names and types\" to name a few. Oh and remember that unless you changed your settings early on, Facebook could also "
"have access to your camera, photos, and GPS location. Because they collect <a id=\"a3\">metadata</a> from your camera too (greedy!) they'll know where you took all your photos and videos, and when "

"One more note on Meta from a privacy researcher’s point of view. Trying to read through Meta's crazy network of privacy policies, privacy FAQs, privacy statements, privacy notices, and supplemental "

"documents that link to other documents that link back even more documents that understanding and making sense of Meta's actual privacy practices feels almost impossible. We wonder if this is by "
"design, to confuse us all so we just give up? Or, if maybe even Meta's own employees possibly don't know and understand the vast network of privacy policies and documentation they have living all "
