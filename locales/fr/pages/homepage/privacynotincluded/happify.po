"Happiness has a score! Scientists who study positive psychology, aka the science of happiness, came up with techniques to make you happier. They can even <a id=\"a1\">tell how happy</a> you are with"
" tests and surveys. Because according to Happify, \"<i>happiness isn't just one thing, it's everything.\"</i> Which sounds kinda existential to us. We also agree that would look great on a "
"motivational poster. The Happify app is a bunch of science-based activities and games designed to help users beat stress, negative thoughts, and life's challenges. Lord knows life has a bunch of "
"those. The app is free to download. To access all it has to offer, users <a id=\"a2\">need to pay</a> a $15 per month or a $140 per year subscription fee for Happify Plus."

"First of all, we're not at all sure why Happify needs access to your phone's flashlight, but indeed, it does request permission to control your device's flashlight when you download the app. Which "

"Happify does collect a fair amount of personal information and app usage data, as we found with nearly all the mental health apps we reviewed. They do say they can use data they collect for "
"advertising purposes. Happify also says they reserve the right to share or sell aggregate or group data about Happify users. Generally, this aggregate data is data with no personally identifiable "
"information. However, with the use of things like device identifiers and location data, both of which Happify says they can collect, it has been found <a id=\"a1\">to be</a> <a id=\"a2\">relatively "

"On the security front, we were unable to confirm is Happify has a way to manage security vulnerabilities. We emailed the company multiple times at the email provided in their privacy policy for "
"privacy related questions to try and get answers to our questions. We received no response. There is this line in Happify's privacy policy (many privacy policies we read contain something similar) "
"that states, <i>\"Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data "
"transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your Personal Information, and "
"technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your Personal Information.\"</i> Which is a good reminder that, yeah, any personal data you share pretty much anywhere on"
