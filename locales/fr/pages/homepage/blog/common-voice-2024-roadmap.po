"We’ve been focusing on improving the health of our text corpora. Last year we migrated sentence collection into the Common Voice platform which has resulted in a 100% increase in rate of languages "
"ingesting new sentences and a 300% increase in people becoming sentence contributors. This year we’ve already worked to include our text corpus into our datasets, and will be working soon to move "
"quality and assurance processes for our sentences into the Common Voice platform. This will make it faster and easier to grow the text corpus with high quality contributions across languages. We’ll "
"also be prototyping some human in the loop ‘commentary’ tools that may be useful for other ML practitioners."

"perspectives, and go on a learning journey with them. We’ll share our reflections and hold space for discussion in 2025."
