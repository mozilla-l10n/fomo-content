"Mozambicans, especially those in rural areas, can experience injustice regarding employment law, land ownership, inheritance, and more. For example, workers whose employers are late with payments "
"sometimes go weeks or months without wages, racking up enormous debts from loans they take to meet living expenses. Meanwhile, some Mozambicans have also been unlawfully forced off of lands they own"
" by big developers and corporations. Widows have become destitute when their deceased husbands’ extended families seize their land and assets, which is against the law but standard practice."

"Equip Mozambique’s Juris Law and Rights Campaign’s goal is twofold – to teach people about their legal rights, and to help them effectively exercise them. The organization developed the Juris app to"
" provide accurate information about the areas of Mozambican law that are most relevant to vulnerable populations including workers, women, and landowners. The app uses text and images designed to be"
" accessible to wide audiences, but it’s only one part of the solution. “We found that many people don’t have cell phones, and digital-only isn’t a great solution for Mozambique,” Reinagel said. The "
"app is a piece of what Reinagel calls a larger “law and justice ecosystem.” It includes performance dramas demonstrating how to advocate for oneself in common scenarios of rights violations; social "
"media and radio outreach campaigns; and other gatherings to spread awareness and understanding."

"Juris Law recently began bringing in lawyers to speak to women at a local sewing school about their legal rights, many of whom are widows and single mothers. “Their response was a righteous anger – "
"many of them said they wouldn’t be in their desperate situation if they had just known what their rights were,” Reinagel said. Hearing the women’s stories first-hand continues to motivate the team "
"to do everything it can to equip them with the information they need to advocate for themselves."

"One major benefit of the Juris app is that people can use it to determine whether or not they even need a lawyer or whether they would be better served going straight to a governmental agency. If "
"people use the app as a first port of call, it can make them more informed clients when they eventually first meet with a lawyer, freeing up lawyers to work on the most urgent cases. \"We will know "
"our work is done when our app becomes the first step for learning about the law and rights before interacting with a lawyer, and when this project is being supported by a team of local developers,\""
