"The CEO of the app formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk, has repeatedly said he wants X to become an “<a id=\"a1\">everything app</a>” that competes with platforms like YouTube, apps like FaceTime "
"and even your bank. With the recent release of audio and video calls, as X does its best <a id=\"a2\">WhatsApp impression</a>, the “X” app is taking yet another step toward that. From the messaging "
"section of the app, users can now tap the phone icon to instantly give their X friends a ring. (X friends as in Twitter friends, not ex-friends.)"

"If you use X’s app, congratulations — you’re already opted-in to the service’s new call feature! This isn’t great because when you place calls with the app, IP address could be shared with anyone "
"you talk to. What is an IP Address? An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet. While an IP address isn’t enough to "
"reveal confidential information directly, <a id=\"a1\">it can be used by hackers</a> for tracking, targeting ads and cyber attacks."

"X isn’t known for being the safest way to chat privately with someone. The service only received encryption in 2023 and X stops short at calling end-to-end encryption. What X offers as encryption is"
" deemed <a id=\"a1\">weaker than</a> what’s used by apps like <a id=\"a2\">Signal</a> and or even Meta’s <a id=\"a3\">WhatsApp</a> (it isn’t on by default and doesn’t allow for sending photos or "
"videos, for example). X calling may be convenient for some, but as far as privacy is concerned, you may be better off with an app like the open-source <a id=\"a4\">Signal</a> or, if you still can’t "
"get enough of scrolling through tweets on X, using the website instead of installing the app."
