"Over 90% of the dating apps reviewed — like Tinder, Bumble, Scruff, Her, OKCupid, and Facebook Dating — received the *Privacy Not Included warning label from Mozilla researchers, a privacy nosedive "
"since their <a id=\"a1\">last review in 2021</a>. Most dating apps (80%) share or sell your personal information and won’t guarantee all users the right to delete their data. For example, Match "

"The majority of apps studied also collect users’ geolocation by default unless they opt-out. Other apps like Hinge, Tinder, OKCupid, Match, Plenty of Fish, BLK, and BlackPeopleMeet adamantly insist "
"on accessing users' precise geo-location data, and can still collect this data whether someone is using the app or not. For example, Hinge’s privacy policies states: “The collection of your "

"precise geolocation, we will not collect it, and our services that rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.\" This real-time geo-tracked data can be <a id=\"a1\">leaked</a> and sold,"

"At the same time, dating apps are getting hungrier for personal information, encouraging building a detailed profile to give potential matches a glimpse into their interests, hobbies, worldviews, "

"In addition to addictive design patterns, and collecting behemoth amounts of data, dating apps are also integrating generative AI into their platforms. Grindr, for instance, plans to use direct "

"evaluate how good or bad it might be for users’ privacy. Tinder, OkCupid, Facebook Dating, Happn, CoffeeMeetsBagel, and Tantan use AI to boost the chances of better matches — and the probability "
"that <a id=\"a2\">disenchanted Gen Zers</a> will stay and pay for these apps. <a id=\"a3\">AI and romance</a> are getting too close for comfort, and when used to make matches or to chat with "
"potential daters, they could propagate <a id=\"a4\">sexual racism</a> or fatphobia. In February, Mozilla researchers revealed the murky AI romantic chatbot privacy policies that enabled companies to"
