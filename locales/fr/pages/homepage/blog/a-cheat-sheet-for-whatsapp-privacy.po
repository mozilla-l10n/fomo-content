"One of the most widely used messaging platforms, WhatsApp, <a id=\"a1\">has almost 2 billion users globally</a>. The free, cross-platform messaging program enables people to make video and voice "
"calls, send text messages, and more. WhatsApp is particularly well-liked and trusted among friends and family who wish to stay in touch<a id=\"a2\"> but live in different countries</a>."

"In the last couple of years, however, some of that user trust has eroded as the Facebook (now Meta) owned platform rolled out privacy policy updates <a id=\"a1\">in 2021</a> that sparked backlash "

"Ivan Righi, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at <a id=\"a1\">Digital Shadows</a>, a San Francisco-based provider of digital risk protection solutions, says that many messaging services, "

"But people should be aware that messages are still stored on local devices and backed up to the device that’s running the app, Righi says. “Even if such messages are deleted from phones, it is "
"likely that they could still be recovered from the phone with the use of forensic tools,” he says. “In some cases, however, the data may have been overwritten or encrypted, making it inaccessible "
"after deletion.”"

"Because WhatsApp is able to share data like your phone number and profile name with Facebook, some users may worry about the security. Misha Rykov, a privacy and data analyst at Mozilla, "

"“So, Facebook can track who sends WhatsApp messages, when, to whom, from which location (if a user allows), etc - but not the content itself,” Rykov says “This creates a privacy concern for people "
"who want full anonymity. These people should consider using more privacy-enhancing apps like Signal, Threema, Wire instead.”"

"Another thing to know about WhatsApp security: when you use the app to text with businesses on, can you count on those conversations actually being <a id=\"a1\">less private</a>. That’s because "
"messaging with businesses is different from messaging with your family or friends. For example, large businesses need to use hosting services to manage their communication so they have the option to"
" use <a id=\"a2\">secure hosting services</a> from Meta to manage WhatsApp chats with their customers, answer questions, and send helpful information like purchase receipts. Thus, communication with"
