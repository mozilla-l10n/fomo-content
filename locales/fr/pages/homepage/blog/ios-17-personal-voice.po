"It’s easy to forget how impressive it is that many folks walk around with a supercomputer in their pocket. Similarly, it’s easy to take for granted just how impressive a feature like Personal Voice "
"in iOS 17 actually is. “Even five years ago, doing this on-device, and getting this kind of quality, wouldn’t have been possible,” says Em. “It’s amazing that Apple’s solution only requires 150 "
"utterances — it’s a step ahead of anything else consumer-facing that I’ve seen.”"

"Perhaps more impressive than the tech are its real world uses. Apple’s Personal Voice feature’s accessibility benefits can’t be understated. It significantly improves on what was previously "
"available. Em points to an example she saw via Common Voice: “When I first joined Common Voice, it was really exciting to hear some of the different text-to-speech applications,” says Em. “One of "
"them was a professor who was going to lose her voice due to a medical illness but really wanted to continue lecturing in her own voice. Use cases like that are why I think tools like these are "
"really exciting.”"

"In many ways, English is the language of the internet — <a id=\"a1\">64%</a> of websites use English as their primary language. Similarly, tech companies often release their products in English "
"first. Case in point: Apple’s Personal Voice feature. Designed in California, Personal Voice in iOS 17 is only available in Apple’s first language."

"With over 100 languages, Common Voice is angling to reduce the internet’s reliance on English. According to Em, data about English speech was easy to find, data about English voices with non-"
"dominant accents, less so and languages out of low resource communities even less so."

"“It’s really a vicious cycle,” says Em. “The internet is basically in a few languages so the next generation communicate mostly online using second or third languages — English, Spanish, French — "
"while the language of their grandparents becomes increasingly forgotten. It’s normal and natural for Apple to roll out in English first, but it reinforces a dynamic we often see where anglocentrism "
"of technology has real consequences for internet users whose first language isn’t a dominant one.”"

"English will probably be the internet’s default language for a while. Ask Common Voice and they’d say part of the fix here is data donation. “More diverse training data is part of the solution for "
"this,” says Em. “Communities need to get together and mobilize to create datasets. Waiting for companies to come along and fix it and take an interest in their language community isn’t the way to go"
" — because if companies don’t see serious commercial viability, they often won’t go there. So it really makes sense for communities to try and solve this problem themselves and say, ‘okay, we want "
"speech recognition to work for us, we’re going to collect that data for ourselves and for our communities and for folks that speak our language.’”"
