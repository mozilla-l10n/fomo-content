"<b>(HARARE, ZIMBABWE | THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2024)</b> — As governments, communities, and businesses across southern Africa continue to integrate AI technologies into everyday life, they face three "
"key challenges, according to new research conducted by the <a id=\"a1\">Media Institute of Southern Africa</a> (MISA) and supported by Mozilla. MISA explored patterns of AI deployment in the sub-"
"region, and how the lack of a regulatory framework hinders ethical AI adoption. The research draws on Zimbabwe's August 2023 election as a case study."

"<b>AI readiness</b>, <b>AI deployment</b>, and <b>potential misuse of AI</b> present the highest barriers as AI systems transition from Western contexts to southern African contexts, researchers "
"found. Methodology entailed a wide landscape review of AI applications across academia, policy, and business; an analysis of AI use cases; and also focus group discussions in Harare and Bulawayo "
"(Zimbabwe) and Johannesburg (South Africa). Focus group participants included lawyers, academics, civic society leaders, activists, media practitioners, and other AI experts."

"<b>AI readiness</b>: AI readiness remains a formidable challenge in most Southern African countries due to insufficient AI-supporting facilities and infrastructure. The availability of reliable "
"electricity, restricted internet access, and sufficient computational power are essential prerequisites for the uptake of AI. Several African nations continue to face challenges in these domains, "
"necessitating significant improvements. It is imperative to acknowledge that the preparedness of a nation for AI also entails the acquisition of new skills or the recruitment of individuals "
"possessing key abilities."

"<b>AI deployment</b>: AI use is proliferating in the region, offering significant opportunities for socio-economic development — but significant knowledge and data gaps hinder ethical AI "
"development, regulation, and monitoring. In terms of policy and legislation, many countries have a good legislative basis for ethical AI use. A clear trend exists in producing and adopting reports "
"and laws that cite AI use in the context of the 4th Industrial Revolution. However, while policy development and the creation of regulatory mechanisms are underway to harness the benefits of AI in "
"service of national development priorities, ethical risks and challenges exist that can exacerbate inequality and social instability if not adequately and timely addressed."

"<b>Potential misuse of AI:</b> The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission implemented a biometric voting system to improve the nation's electoral process. To vote in the country, one would need to register "
"as a voter with their biometric data. As a result of the process of providing one's biometric data, many voters were under the impression that the government could use their data to track them. "
"During the elections in 2023, the ruling party boasted that they had used drones to record images and count the number of people who attended rallies held by the opposition, according to media "
"reports. Another potential risk of AI is the manipulation of individual voting decisions before an election via targeted disinformation campaigns. Search engines and social networks spread "
"information in ways that differ from the press. Search engines and social networks mostly present third-party material while providing little of their own. This means that even unprofessionally "
"generated, different information can rapidly spread."
