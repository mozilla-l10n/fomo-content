"“Not My Type” provides a socio-technical examination of the AI systems powering Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and other apps. Williams uses deep analysis of companies’ patents and technology to reveal how "
"racism and romance are now inextricably linked through computer code. She also interviews more than 100 app users, exploring why online dating as a person of color is so fraught."

"Williams places this dynamic in a broader historical context, linking today’s digital practices to the long history of eugenics and banned interracial partnerships in the U.S. Ultimately, “Not My "
"Type” calls for a reconceptualization of dating apps, policies that govern dating agencies, and a reexamination of sociocultural beliefs about attraction, beauty, and desirability."

"<b>Says Dr. Apryl Williams:</b> “Sexual racism is a central feature, not a bug, in today’s online dating culture. Powerful matchmaking algorithms excel at matching people of similar ethnicities, "
"races, and skin colors — and also excel at separating people with different ones. In many ways, today’s dating apps are an extension of long-standing laws and persistent taboos about mixed-race "
"couples in America.”"

"<b>Says Dr. Safiya Noble, the author of “Algorithms of Oppression” and a MacArthur Fellow who provides a forward for the book</b>: “Williams makes the mundane, naturalized practice of online dating "
"a matter we should think about more carefully. This book will take a reader on a journey through a history of race and racism, while educating us on how power systems are embedded in online dating "
"applications. I consider this book to be illustrative of the very real and difficult work of making the invisible value structures of algorithmic and machine learning systems visible, at a time when"
" we so desperately need these kinds of data literacies.”"
