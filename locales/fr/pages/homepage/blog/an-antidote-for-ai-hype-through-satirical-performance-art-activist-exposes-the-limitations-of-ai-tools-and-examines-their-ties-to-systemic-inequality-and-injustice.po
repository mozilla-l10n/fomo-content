"<b>(SAN FRANCISCO | JUNE 4, 2024)</b> - Don’t believe all the marketing hype around AI. There are some serious downsides, warns the creator of <a id=\"a1\">Artificial Life Coach</a> (ALC) — a <a "
"id=\"a2\">Mozilla Creative Media Award</a> recipient — who uses satirical performance art on social media to encourage critical thinking about AI. ALC explores how AI can deepen existing racial, "
"economic, and gender inequities, expose communities to algorithmic harms, and further entrench power in the hands of a few. The stakes are high and disastrous consequences can hit the vulnerable the"
" hardest, ALC notes."

"Through thought-provoking content and humor, Artificial Life Coach redirects attention to the ethical and societal implications of AI by targeting a particularly vulnerable group: young women. The "

"Inspired by magicians like Harry Houdini, who exposed the parlor tricks behind psychic claims in the early 20th century, ALC discourages its audience from treating AI like a crystal ball, using it "
"to make decisions and predictions even when evidence shows it often fails. The moniker pokes fun at Silicon Valley’s <a id=\"a1\">embrace</a> of questionable shamans, gurus, and coaches to solve "
"every world, business, and personal problem — and exposes the AI industry’s ethics washing."
