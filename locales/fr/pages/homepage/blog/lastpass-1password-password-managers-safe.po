"<b>Using the same password for every account</b>: Using one password with every account can be convenient and easy to remember. But the downside is that a single password could give hackers access "

"Another consideration is checking if your password manager stores your data in the cloud. Most do, in order to make accessing your credentials across devices easier. Though storing info in the "

"When it comes to password managers like 1Password, Bitwarden and others, use of encryption is (pun) key. Storing account info in a password manager can be more secure than keeping your passwords in "
