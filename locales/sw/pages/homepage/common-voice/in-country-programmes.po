"Common Voice is the most diverse open voice dataset in the world. Most voice datasets are owned by companies, which stifles innovation. They also under-represent almost every language in the world, "
"as well as people of colour, disabled people, women and LGBTQIA+ people. We want to change that by mobilising people everywhere to share their voice."

"The project is developing a chatbot and an interactive voice response service that will provide voice-enabled services in the domain of business registration and raise awareness about the use of "

"further credit as a result of using moveable properties as collateral. This project will be a continuation of an already ongoing collaboration with the Business Registration Service - BRS (State "
