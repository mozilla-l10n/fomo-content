"Have you ever wondered if technology has a gender? And if it does, is it female or male? We can refer to technology being genderless, but often favors one gender over another. Women are often left "
"behind even though many technologies are given feminine names like Alexa and others, does this have any effect on technology? Creating integrated technology forces us to answer these questions and "
"find solutions to ensure technology does not leave any person or group behind."

"Je umewahi jiuliza kama teknolojia ina jinsia? Na kama ina jinsia, je ni ya kike au ya kiume? Kwa haraka tunaweza sema teknolojia haina jinsia, ila mara nyingi hupendelea jinsia moja kuliko "
"nyingine.Mara nyingi wanawake huachwa nyuma ingawa teknolojia nyingi hupewa majina ya kike kama Alexa na mengine,je hii ina athari yoyote kwa teknolojia? Kujenga teknolojia jumuishi inatulazimisha "
"kujibu maswali haya na kutafuta muafaka wa kuhakikisha teknolojia haimuachi mtu au kundi lolote nyuma."

"In voice technology, researchers have identified the existence of gender challenges, for example, voice technology does not represent everyone's voice and differences so sometimes these systems fail"
" to recognize certain sounds especially in terms of gender and different accents. What contributes to these challenges? In Mozilla's Common Voice project, we were able to address some of the "

"mtu kutumia na kuchapisha upya apendavyo, bila vikwazo kama hakimiliki.Kuwepo kwa data zilizo wazi husaidia kukuza utengenezaji wa teknolojia mbali mbali kama teknolojia ya sauti kwani hakutakuwa na"

"Voice technologies recognize more men's voices than women's voices. This is also due to the lack of inclusive data that is gender sensitive. <a id=\"a1\">A research</a> by Tatman published by the "

"Access and affordability of the Internet for different genders can also impact adaptation and use of technology, in developing countries many women are unable to access technology. Access comes in "
"two forms: access to devices and access to the technology, so they are unable to use the Internet. In many countries, especially in Africa, the cost of the internet and access devices are high, so "
"many women with low-incomes are forced to choose between eating or paying to connect to the internet. This is because many voice technology solutions require sufficient bandwidth which many cannot "
"afford."
