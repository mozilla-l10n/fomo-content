"By some estimates, there are one billion people using TikTok around the world. The social media platform has led the industry in engaging content and new features, but has lagged behind when it "
"comes to delivering on key aspects of transparency, such as sharing information about who is paying for advertising on its platform."

"TikTok’s release of an ad archive, which includes branded posts from influencers alongside traditional ads, is real progress. This is in compliance with the European Union’s Digital Services Act, "
"legislation that Mozilla has also <a id=\"a1\">advocated for</a>. Substantially, Mozilla’s research helped shaped pertinent sections of the DSA which demanded \"commercial communications\" be "
"explicitly defined as advertising, and encapsulated within the regulation."

"<b>However, last week’s announcement falls short of the transparency we need from TikTok, and all social media companies.</b> Most importantly, TikTok needs to ensure its ad archive is global and "
"not limited to the U.S. and EU. Our <a id=\"a1\">recent research</a> into how TikTok is being used to spread misinformation in Kenya shows the need to have a consistent approach to trust and safety "
