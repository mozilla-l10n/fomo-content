"There has been positive coverage of a recent method published by researchers from the University of Maryland called “Binoculars”, an approach which “look[s] at inputs through the lenses of two "
"different language models.” They provide an open source implementation on <a id=\"a1\">GitHub</a>, but caution that the “implementation is for academic purposes only and should not be considered as "
"a consumer product. We also strongly caution against using Binoculars (or any detector) without human supervision.” Regardless, Business Insider <a id=\"a2\">writes</a>: “A new AI-detection tool may"
" have solved the problem of false positives for student writing, researchers say” while IEEE Spectrum <a id=\"a3\">discusses</a> the method, writing that “Better and more effective AI detection "
"techniques are on the horizon.” The authors write in their <a id=\"a4\">paper</a> that “Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of "
"0.01%”. This means that the method should detect AI-written text 9 out of 10 times and only give a false positive (meaning an incorrect assessment that claims human-written text is AI-written) in 1 "

"We have evaluated just one of many tools available to detect AI-generated text. In fact, we chose to evaluate this tool partly due to its high level of claimed performance, but also due to the fact "
"that such an evaluation is possible due to the responsible open source release provided by the authors – many systems are closed, making third-party evaluation difficult or impossible. However, we "
"feel that our findings are typical and limitations are inherent to the problem: AI-generated text is just not different enough from human-generated text to be able to consistently differentiate "
"them. For a determined actor, if the text they generate is detected as AI, it’s fairly simple to just ask the model to make the text more natural-sounding, try a different model, or just work in "
"languages or text-lengths in which the detectors don’t work. As well, the claims made by the authors of the Binoculars method are based on an evaluation on data generated by a small handful of "
"models; our findings cast doubt on the degree to which they generalize to a broad spectrum of models, whether past or future."

"Even flawed detector tools may have useful applications. For example, a platform might employ such tools to attempt to detect automated accounts and raise accounts flagged for further investigation."
