"MethaneMapper solves the problem of underreported methane emissions. When most oil and gas companies, coal plants, and factory farms ignore leaks in pipes and self-monitor their fields to measure "
"the least carbon and methane possible, emissions accounting and regulation mean very little. MethaneMapper is an open-source, AI-powered hyperspectral imaging tool to detect methane emissions and "
"trace them to their sources. The tool works because data does not come from handheld devices or even individual installed devices that can be easily fooled. The input data is overhead — airborne "
"hyperspectral images of the target area. MethaneMapper is therefore far more accurate and works over a far wider geographic region than traditional monitoring."

"CodeCarbon started in 2020 with a simple question: How can I measure the carbon footprint of my computer program? The team found some global data, like \"computing currently represents roughly 0.5% "
"of the world’s energy consumption,\" but nothing about the impacts of individual/organization-level impacts and where they stem from. At CodeCarbon, the team believes, as Niels Bohr said, that "
"\"Nothing exists until it is measured.\" So they found a way to estimate how much carbon they produce while running our code. They did this by creating a Python package that estimates hardware "
"electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and applies it to the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done to automatically calculate the energy consumption and carbon "
"emissions of any piece of code."
