"<a id=\"a1\"><i>Common Voice</i></a> is a project to help make voice recognition open to everyone. Developers need an enormous amount of voice data to build voice recognition technologies, and "
"currently most of that data is expensive and proprietary. We want to make voice data freely and publicly available, and make sure the data represents the diversity of real people. Together we can "
