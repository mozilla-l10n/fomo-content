"When tech companies scrape the internet to make datasets, they are organizing us. In <i>The Art of Gathering</i>, Priya Parker writes that, “gathering—the conscious bringing together of people for a"

"Let’s focus on datasets that contain images of people (us!) and that are used to train generative AI models. Most of these datasets are not accessible to the public, even if the public is contained "
"within them. For instance, OpenAI’s datasets are private, as are Meta’s and Apple’s. As of this writing, the largest open source dataset of image-text pairs is <a id=\"a1\">LAION-5B</a> (an acronym "
"for “Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network,” with “5B” referring to the dataset’s 5.85 billion image-text pairs). Maintained by a German nonprofit organization, the dataset was compiled "
"by <a id=\"a2\">Common Crawl</a>, another nonprofit that uses bots to systematically browse the internet and archive its contents."
