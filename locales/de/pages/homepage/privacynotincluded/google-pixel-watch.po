"Remember a couple years ago when the announcement came down that <a id=\"a1\">Google was buying Fitbit</a> and there were a ton of concerns for the privacy of Fitbit users? So the EU stepped in and "
"said <a id=\"a2\">they would only approve the deal</a> if Google made some promises about how they would handle all that health data these smart watches can track, like a 10-year ban on using health"
" data for ad targeting for folks in the EU. Fast forward to now, and Google is finally launching their own branded smartwatch they say delivers \"the best of Google and Fitbit\" together. Meet the "
"Google Pixel Watch, an Apple Watch competitor with all the features of a smart watch like Google Wallet, Google Maps, Google Assistant, phone, texts, calendars, and more. And all the fitness "
"tracking features of a Fitbit like steps, heart rate, sleep tracking, fall detection, and more. Sounds like a good thing...if you're not an iPhone user, as there is no iPhone support. Android users "
"only. As for privacy, well, Apple is probably better than Google and Fitbit at that."

"The Google Pixel Watch actually needs two apps to do everything. There’s the Google Pixel Watch app that lets users set up and manage the watch on your Android device (sorry iOS users, no support "
