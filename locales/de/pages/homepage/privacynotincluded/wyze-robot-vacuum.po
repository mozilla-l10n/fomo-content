"LiDAR! Everyone needs a vacuum with LiDAR! LiDAR is basically a spinning laser on top of your vacuum that spins around 6 times a second mapping out your home to 2,016 points in your room. Cool! "
"LiDAR mapping is generally a <a id=\"a1\">safer bet than cameras</a> in your home. However, researchers found that LiDAR robot vacuums can be hacked and used to <a id=\"a2\">spy on voice "
"conversations</a>, even without a microphone. Creepy! The Wyze App allows users to set virtual boundaries to keep the vacuum away from off-limits areas. Want to vacuum while you are away from home? "
"Use the app to track your vacuum in real time as it cruises around your house. So, how is Wyze as privacy and security? Well, not so great we're afraid."

"Let's start with Wyze's last couple of very checkered years when it comes to security and protecting the sensitive personal information their security cams can collect through video and audio. "
"First, in 2022, <a id=\"a1\">security researchers at publication Bitdefender</a> \"found three vulnerabilities that would have given attackers direct access to the cameras, including recordings "
"stored on the SD card.\" <a id=\"a2\">Consumer Reporters followed</a> with a report calling out Wyze for not fixing the security flaws in some Wyze Cams for three years and <a id=\"a3\">did not "

"Beginnen wir mit den letzten paar sehr wechselvollen Jahren von Wyze, wenn es um Sicherheit und den Schutz der sensiblen persönlichen Informationen geht, die ihre Sicherheitskameras über Video und "

"hätten, einschließlich der auf der SD-Karte gespeicherten Aufzeichnungen.\" <a id=\"a2\">Consumer Reporters folgte</a> mit einem Bericht, in dem kritisiert wurde, dass Wyze aufgefordert worden war, "

"Times' Wirecutter to pull their recommendation</a> of Wyze cams to their readers. <a id=\"a4\">USA Today also pulled</a> their recommendation of Wyze security cameras. All this, on top of<a "

"Das war im Jahr 2022, und dann im Jahr 2023, <a id=\"a1\">gab Wyze erneut eine Sicherheitslücke</a> zu, die enthüllte, dass die privaten Videoaufnahmen einiger Kameras ihrer Benutzer*innen Personen "
"im Internet veröffentlicht worden waren. <a id=\"a2\">The Verge berichtete,</a> dass einige Wyze-Benutzer über das Wyze-Webportal Videos von Kameras sehen konnten, die nicht ihre eigenen waren. Dies"

"So, Wyze's security cameras have a pretty bad track record at security and privacy. That's not good. What about <a id=\"a1\">Wyze's privacy policy</a> for their other smart home devices? Is it any "
"better? Not really. Wyze says they can collect a ton of information on you -- lots of personal information, usage information when you use their devices, tracking information, and they even say they"
" can gather more information about your from third party sources. They say they can use all this information to do things like build inferences on you to target you with advertising. And, they say "
"that they can share and even \"sell\" (under the California privacy law CCPA definition of sell) some of your personal information -- including personally identifying information and inferences "
"about you -- to third party advertisers for targeted advertising purposes. Not very private at all."

"Wyzes Sicherheitskameras weisen also eine ziemlich schlechte Erfolgsbilanz hinsichtlich Sicherheit und Datenschutz auf. Das ist nicht gut. Was ist mit der Datenschutzerklärung von <a "
"id=\"a1\">Wyze</a> für ihre anderen Smart-Geräte? Ist diese besser? Nicht wirklich. Wyze sagt, dass sie eine Menge Informationen über Sie sammeln dürfen - viele persönliche Informationen, "
"Nutzungsinformationen, wenn Sie ihre Geräte verwenden, Tracking-Informationen, und sie sagen sogar, dass sie mehr Informationen über Sie von Drittanbietern sammeln dürfen. Sie sagen, dass sie all "
"diese Informationen verwenden können, um beispielsweise Rückschlüsse auf Sie zu ziehen, um Sie mit Werbung anzusprechen. Sie sagen auch, dass sie einige Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten - "
"einschließlich personenbezogener Daten und Rückschlüsse auf Sie - an Drittanbieter für gezielte Werbezwecke weitergeben und sogar \"verkaufen\" können (gemäß der kalifornischen CCPA-Definition von "

"Wyze also says they can share de-identified or aggregated information with third parties, which is pretty common and not always a concern. Although it’s a good time to remind you that it’s <a "

"Wyze sagt auch, dass sie anonymisierte oder aggregierte Informationen mit Dritten teilen dürfen, was ziemlich üblich ist und nicht immer ein Problem darstellt. Es ist zwar ein guter Zeitpunkt, Sie "

"On top of Wyze's bad track record and not-so-great data collecting and sharing policies, Wyze has a few more privacy gripes we'd like to pick. First, Wyze doesn't guarantee everyone the right to "
"have all this data they collect you deleted. They also don' make any mention of how they handle children's data in their privacy policy, which is really bad form. Also, they straight up seem to make"
" claims that aren't factual on the <a id=\"a1\">Data Safety page for the Wyze app in the Google Play Store</a>, when they state that they don't share data with third parties (according to their "
"privacy policy, they do) and that the app doesn't collect any user data (pretty sure it does). <i>(Sidenote: The Google Play Store Data Safety pages have a whole host of problems we talk more "
"about</i> <a id=\"a2\"><i>here</i></a><i>.)</i> Oh, one more thing we found that raised our eyebrows as we were looking into Wyze -- they Wyze app you use to control <a id=\"a3\">Wyze's smart home "
"devices asks for permission</a> to read your text messages (and control your flashlight). That seems a bit weird to us. We're not sure we want Wyze to read out text messages...or control our "
"flashlight. None of these privacy no-nos makes us feel great about Wyze's privacy practices."

msgctxt "worst_case"

"So, what's the worst that could happen? Well, the worst probably already has happened for those poor Wyze users whose cameras were exposed and open to strangers on the internet to spy inside their "
"home without their knowledge. That is very bad. Unfortunately Wyze seems to have gone from an affordable smart home company without too many privacy and security issues, to one of the worst "
"offenders on the market with recurring issues. Our recommendation is to beware that your Wyze smart home devices could come with *privacy not included."
