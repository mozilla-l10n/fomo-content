"Peloton isn't just about bikes anymore. They also sell a couple of high-priced treadmills. Those big bucks get you a shock-absorbing treadmill with a 24 inch touch screen built in so you can feel "
"like you're running on the beach with your trainer when in fact you're stuck inside your apartment. Their app tracks your workouts and gives you access to things like yoga classes and strength "
"training too. Tragically, Peloton had to issue a recall on their Tread+ treadmills when a child was killed when they were pulled under the treadmill. The company also had to issue a recall on their "
"Tread treadmill because the console could detach and fall. Oof, 2021 was not a good year for Peloton Tread. Sadly, their privacy and security isn't so great either."

"Peloton became one of the go-to workout machines for those who could afford them during the pandemic. They’ve had a pretty <a id=\"a1\">rough</a> go of it since though. In early 2023, they agreed to"
" pay a $19 million <a id=\"a2\">civil penalty</a> for a flaw that resulted in a <a id=\"a3\">6-year old being killed</a> in an accident on one of their treadmills back in 2021. Worse, the United "
"States Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that Peloton was aware of “incidents associated with pull under and entrapment in the rear of the treadmills, including reports of injuries” before"
" that design flaw ended in tragedy. The CPSC also said that company staff claimed Peloton continued to distribute the dangerous treadmills even after they <a id=\"a4\">recalled it</a>. (If you have "
