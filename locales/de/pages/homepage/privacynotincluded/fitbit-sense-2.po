"Always wanted an Apple Watch for all the cool health tracking and smart watch features but don't have an iPhone? Fitbit made their new Sense health and fitness tracker for you. This busy little "
"watch measures your heart with an ECG, your blood oxygen levels, your stress through your skin temperature and electrodermal activity, how well (or not well) you are sleeping, it tracks your "
"menstrual cycle, and more. It'll also track you with GPS, count your steps and calories and active minutes. The Sense literally knows when you are sleeping and knows when you are awake and knows if "
"you've been bad or good. Santa, we see you."
