"Subaru is a Japanese car company started back in the 1950s. Their all-wheel drive, sporty SUVs and cars are popular with outdoor types and the LGBT+ community (and your privacy researcher's "
"Mom...Mom swears by Subaru and has since the 1980s). Popular models in the Outback, Forester, Crosstrek, Impreza, Legacy, the sporty WRX, and the electric Solterra. The MySubaru app and Subaru's "
"Starlink connected services offer up all the usual connected car things like remote start/stop, lock/unlock, honk your horn and flash your lights from bedroom, automatic collision notification, "
"multimedia services like navigation and news, trip logs, and a way to manage other people who might drive your Subaru with boundary, speed, and curfew alerts. So, do we love Subaru's privacy? Not "

"If you go read Subaru's privacy policy (or don't, we did it for you, you can just read our review here), you'll see at the very start they say this: <i>\"This Privacy Policy applies to each user of "

"established that by getting in the connected Subaru, you're using their \"services.\" Now they're saying you've consented to the things they lay out in their privacy policy by simply getting in that"

"According to that privacy policy, what exactly are you consenting to by sitting in that Subaru or using their connected services or their MySubaru app. Well, first off, you're consenting to a whole "

" location and movements), vehicle telemetry data like speed and tire pressure, to audio recordings of vehicle occupants, and even inferences they can draw about your characteristics, behaviors, and "
"predispositions. You're also consenting to allow Subaru to collect even more data about from places like data brokers (or data service companies as they call them), or possibly even <i>\"certain "
"features of your mobile device, including its camera, location services (GPS), microphone and contacts, and collect Information from those features, such as photographs, videos, your precise "
"location, audio recordings, and contact information.\"</i><br/><br/>That's a lot of information Subaru says they can collect on you! But that's not all. You're also then consenting to have that "
"personal information shared -- or even possibly sold -- to third parties like marketing companies, those data service providers (aka data brokers), other Subaru affiliates and service providers, law"

"As for how good a job Subaru does at protecting all that personal and car data, well, their track record is certainly better than many of the car companies we reviewed. They did have a <a "

"So, do you as a driver or passenger of a Subaru have any options when it comes to the company collecting, sharing, and maybe even selling your data? Well, of course you do! According to Subaru, it's"

msgctxt "worst_case"

"Seriously though, it's one thing to uninstall the app and not use it. But what happens if you own your Subaru and want it to stop collecting information on you, especially if Subaru happens to "
"change up their (already not super privacy-friendly) privacy policy to say they can collect even more data on you and share it with who knows who for some crazy purpose you don't like. You can opt "
"out of that, right? Have it deleted, at the very least? Probably not. Their privacy policy says, in giant ALL CAPS to make sure you know they mean business, <i>\" IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO CHANGES TO "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"

"It seems the best way to keep Subaru from collecting, sharing, or selling your data to people who want to sell you stuff or data brokers or law enforcement, your best bet is to never buy, drive, or "
"ride in a Subaru. Except if you're walking on the street when a car with exterior cameras or sensors drives by. Then you might get caught up in that data collection too. So, yeah, the point is, you "
"really don't have many great choices when it comes to protecting your privacy from connected cars these days, other than to never buy them, drive them, sit in them, or exist on the street when they "
"drive by. This isn't just a Subaru problem -- far from it -- this is a modern connected car problem and something really needs to be done about it. We're looking at your policy makers and "

"So, what's the worst that could happen with your happy little Subaru Outback? Well, it would really stink to go visit your Mom, go for a ride in her new Subaru with all it's fancy, connected "

"law enforcement because Subaru says in their privacy policy they can share or sell that personal information, including to \"<i>detect and prevent criminal activity.\"</i> That is perhaps a far "
