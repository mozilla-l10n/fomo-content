"Lincoln -- <a id=\"a1\">named after</a> the US president who ended slavery, Abraham Lincoln -- is the luxury car brand of US car maker Ford. Founded back in 1917 the company was renowned for their "
"1970s Lincoln Continental, a giant boat of car with doors that weighed as much as modern small cars probably weigh now (seriously, does anyone remember being a kid and trying to open the door on a "
"Lincoln Continental?). Lincoln models today include the Navigator, Aviator, Nautilus, and Corsair. Lincoln owners can connect to their car through the <a id=\"a2\">Lincoln Way app</a> and do things "
"like remotely lock/unlock, and start their cars, create virtual valet keys, and check things like tire pressure and maintenance schedules. So, how does Lincoln do at protecting your privacy? Well, "
"they share their privacy policies with parent company Ford, and both car brands a pretty dang bad a privacy."

"Starting way back in 1903, Ford has a very long history of building cars and getting people in them. Sometimes that <a id=\"a1\">history</a> has been less than perfect (remember the <a "
