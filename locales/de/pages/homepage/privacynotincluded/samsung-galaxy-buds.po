"Samsung offers many versions of their Galaxy earbuds. There's the Buds2, Buds Pro, Buds Live, and Buds+. That's a lot of Buds. And these tiny earbuds come in lots of shiny colors. They do the things"

"find them, but only if they are already connected to your phone, so don't lose these little guys if their battery is dead or you're more than 32 feet away. Oh, and FYI, Samsung is pretty bad at "

"Not gonna lie, it sure seems Samsung likes to collect a lot of data on users, young and old alike (seriously, <a id=\"a1\">the children's data section</a> in their Samsung account privacy policy "

"geolocation, browsing history, the super-broad “sensory information” and information that you store on your device like your photos, contacts, text logs, and calendar information. Oh my! And that’s "
"on top of the standard account information most companies collect, like your contact and payment information. They can also create “inferences” about you -- which are assumptions about your "

"It’s finally silver lining time! It seems like Samsung might (but probably not) extend the rights that protect users under California’s stronger privacy law, CCPA, to all of the United States, since"

"Unfortunately though, Samsung doesn’t make that promise to all its users (even in the US) in their privacy policy. They say those rights are “subject to applicable law” so they’re not guaranteed no "
