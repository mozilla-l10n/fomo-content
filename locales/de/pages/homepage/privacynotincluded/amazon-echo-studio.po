"\"You've never heard an Echo like this before,\" claims Amazon with their new high end smart speaker. Designed to compete with better sounding speakers like the Apple Homepod Mini and Sonos smart "
"speakers, this chunkier, better sounding version of the Echo Dot comes with 5 speakers, 3D soundscape, spatial audio processing and room adapting technology, as well as plenty of ways to listen to "
"what you say with those smart microphones. The Echo Studio can act as a smart home hub and control all those Amazon Alexa connected lights, plugs, Fire TV sticks, cameras, locks, thermostats, and "
"more. Amazon claims this fancy speaker is also \"designed to protect your privacy\" with a microphone off button and the ability to ask Alexa to delete those voice recordings you just made. That's "
"all well and good, but we'd caution anyone in thinking Amazon is a privacy respecting company. They just love your data and it's good to remember that."

"Oh, let’s not forget Amazon’s track record at protecting and respecting their customers' data. That raises some red flags too. Here are a few of the problems we’ve seen over the last few years. "

"So, what’s the worst that could happen? Well, if you happen to order that pregnancy test through Alexa, Amazon now knows you might be pregnant. Then comes the ads for baby clothes, diapers, cribs, "
"and more. And then tragedy strikes and you lose your pregnancy. To cope you buy wine from Whole Foods. Amazon could now assume you’re no longer pregnant. But they don’t know about this miscarriage, "
"they just know that you were likely pregnant and now likely not. Setting aside the scary post-Roe vs Wade world we live in now where this information could be used by law enforcement, think of the "
"targeted advertising you could get from companies trying to sell you more stuff to deal with your lost pregnancy, get pregnant again, or other ads you don’t need to see while trying to cope with "
"this tragedy. Uhg. So yeah, while Amazon doesn't sell your personal information, they sure do use the heck out of it to target you with more stuff to buy. Is this creepy? Well, with so much data "
