"Netatmo’s HD smart video doorbell lets you know if someone’ lurking at your front door and lets you yell at them through the microphone to “Get of your lawn!” Netatmo doesn’t record video to the "
"Cloud, which is another great privacy feature. All video is recorded locally on an encrypted MicroSD card. You have the option to save it to Dropbox if you want. Good work Netatmo, we’re impressed."

"We love that Netatmo offers only local storage on a MicroSD card as that’s generally a much safer way to save your video than storing it in the Cloud. And because Netatmo is headquartered in France,"
" it appears their privacy policy applies Europe’s stricter <a id=\"a1\">GDPR privacy regulations</a> to all their data collection, which is great for users. They don’t sell data. They are very "
"cautious about who they share data with."

"We love that Netatmo seems to take privacy and security seriously. It’s a great thing to see from makers of security cameras. What’s the worst that could happen? Well, we suppose your video doorbell"
" could catch your neighbor singing show tunes on their front lawn. Remember folks, use your video doorbell to spy on your front porch, not your neighbor’s front lawn! That’s just being neighborly."
