"For those of us who don't live with a doctor, there's the Withings Body smart scales. They do everything from weigh you to measure your heart rate, water percentage, bone and muscle mass. It takes "
"all that personal information and shares it with an app on your phone where you can set up personalized programs to keep your weight right where you want it. If you have the willpower, that is. Good"
