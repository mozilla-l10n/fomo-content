"Amazon Ring's indoor and outdoor security cameras have all the usual--HD video, night vision, motion activation--to put your house under 24-hour surveillance. Monitor the video through the Ring app "

"Amazon’s Ring security cameras and video doorbells are the <a id=\"a1\">most widely used</a> home video cameras in many parts of the world today. As one expert from US privacy org the Electronic "
"Frontier Foundation <a id=\"a2\">put it,</a> \"Ring has steadily been becoming one of the largest surveillance apparatuses in the nation.” And as wise comic book prophet Stan Lee reminds us, “With "
"great power comes great responsibility.” Has Amazon Ring lived up to that great responsibility? <a id=\"a3\">No, they haven’t</a>."

"Ring has a history of not protecting users' privacy. At one point <a id=\"a1\">they reportedly stored customer data</a>--including video recordings--unencrypted on an Amazon cloud server and "
"employees could access any of this data. There have also been reported <a id=\"a2\">data leaks</a> and concerns that the Ring Doorbell app is full of <a id=\"a3\">third-party trackers</a> tracking a"
" good amount of personal information that Amazon Ring doesn’t disclose. They have gotten more transparent in their privacy and data deletion practices, which we appreciate. And they added <a "
"id=\"a4\">two-factor authentication</a> to help protect users in 2020, which was a great step forward. One we here at Mozilla <a id=\"a5\">pushed hard</a> for."

"While <a id=\"a3\">Amazon says</a> they are distancing themselves from law enforcement access to users' video and requiring more transparency in the process, they are still facilitating law "
"enforcement access with this product and the <a id=\"a4\">Neighbors app</a> and that leaves us concerned. They also admitted in 2022 they <a id=\"a5\">still share video with law enforcement</a> "

"There is also the question of <a id=\"a1\">privacy violations of the neighbors</a> of people who use home surveillance cameras -- not just Ring but all of home surveillance cameras. A recent court "

"What’s the worst that could happen? Well, beyond the snooping next door neighbor, the trigger happy, paranoid surveillance junky, and the questionable law enforcement partnerships, there’s the big "
"concerns about all this constant surveillance. In the United States where abortion has become illegal in a number of states, it is possible anti-abortion activists could use these surviellance "
"cameras to spy on women who are pregnant to see if they carry their fetus to term. And if they don’t -- no matter the reason -- video from these cameras could potentially be used to harass, arrest, "
"and potentially even prosecute women seeking reproductive healthcare, for whatever reason. This is bad. All in all, these security cameras raise too many questions about privacy, transparency, data "
"protection, public safety and racism in our opinion. For this reason, we say they come with *Privacy Not Included."
