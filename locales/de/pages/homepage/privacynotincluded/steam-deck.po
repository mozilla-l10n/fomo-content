"If you're a serious PC gamer, you probably use Steam, the online game store, community, and place to go to find and play over 30,000 games. Owned by Valve, Steam recently launched their handheld "
"console, Steam Deck, to let PC gamers play someone other than their PC. And so far, based on how hard it's been to get a Steam Deck, the latest video game console referred to as a <a "
"id=\"a1\">\"Nintendo Switch for adults\"</a> by one publication, is a success. That's all fine and dandy, but how does Valve's Steam Deck do at privacy? Well, eh, they aren't the worst, we'll give "
"them that."

"Good news! Valve's <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>, which covers the Steam Deck and the Steam store, doesn't raise any huge privacy concerns for us. It’s a little vague for our tastes, but we didn’t"
" see any big red flags. We like that they say they don't require users to provide a real name when signing up for a Steam User Account. You will need to provide an email and a user name, and then "
"will be assigned a Steam ID number that will be used to reference your account, rather than something more personally identifiable. This is good. Of course, Valve still says they can collect "
"personal information on you, including any information you provide identifying yourself in posts to chats or message boards, so, as always, be aware of what you share online."

"Here’s the bad news about the Steam Deck though. We can’t confirm it meets our Minimum Security Standards because we can’t confirm it uses encryption or if Valve has a way to manage security "

"What’s the worst that could happen with your brand new Steam Deck playing all those games online? Well, Steam is an online gaming community and those have been known to be pretty toxic, especially "

"decent job handling your personal information, we’re not so sure every person on Steam will do the same. You don’t need to get doxxed or swatted or whatever the latest form of gaming <a "
"id=\"a2\">harassment</a> is because you overshared (or heck, just even shared) while playing Call of Duty."
