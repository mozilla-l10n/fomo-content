"Withings' little smart thermometer lets you take a temperature without coming in contact with the body, which is cool because sick people are sweaty. It's got a brightly lit display that can track "
"the temperature readings of up to eight people. And it will sync temperature readings with the smartphone app automatically over WiFi so no need to Bluetooth sync. Based on your temperature and "
"symptoms the app can recommend when it's time to take action. So, will Withings overshare with the world that you have a fever? Well, actually, their privacy looks pretty decent to us."
