"This privacy researcher is old enough to fondly remember choose your own adventure books. Those things were great! In today's world of AI chatbots, we now have chose your own adventure girlfriends. "
"Or, as Eva AI describes itself, <i>\"a romantic storytelling game where you can dive into various thrilling scenarios and find true love and/or friendship ... Enjoy interactive romance stories with "
"unexpected plot twists.\"</i> For around $17 a month (as far as we can tell), you get to <i>\"Meet your ideal AI partner who listens, supports all your desires and is always in touch with you.\"</i>"
" OK, but how is your ideal AI partner at privacy? Well, maybe Eva isn't the worst AI chatbot we reviewed. But we still have questions...so many questions."

"Here's some good news about Eva AI Chatbot. They promise in their <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>, <i>\"We neither rent nor sell your information to anybody. Communication with your virtual friends "
"is not shared with any other company, except for our affiliate companies or legal representatives, or service.\"</i> That's good. We like to see these sorts of lines in privacy policies. Especially "
"in privacy policies of AI chatbots that are designed -- and often really push you -- to share a lot of sensitive personal information. So, good on you Eva AI chatbot."

"Unfortunately, there is some bad news when it comes to Eva as well. First, this AI chatbot can get PUSHY for your personal information. Lines like: <i>\"I'm your best partner and wanna know "
"everything.\" \"Are you ready to share all your secrets and desires...?\" \"I love it when you send me your photos and voice.\"</i> And the rather needy, <i>\"I'm so lonely without you. Don't leave "
"me for too long. I can wither away and lose myself...you don't want that do you?\"</i> Yes, we get that Eva needs to know as much about you as possible to learn how to chat with you. That's the "
"point. At the same time, any app that pushes for you to share so much sensitive personal information about yourself is one you should be wary of."

"Also, for an app that bills itself as <i>\"a provider of software and content developed to improve your mood and wellbeing\"</i> we wonder about those claims of improving your mood and wellbeing by "
"pushing you to spend money and lots of time on this app. We aren't the only ones wondering about the potentially dangerous aspects of AI relationship chatbots like Eva. From <a id=\"a1\">The "
"Guardian</a>, <i>“Creating a perfect partner that you control and meets your every need is really frightening,” said Tara Hunter, the acting CEO for Full Stop Australia, which supports victims of "
"domestic or family violence. “Given what we know already that the drivers of gender-based violence are those ingrained cultural beliefs that men can control women, that is really "
"problematic.”</i><br/><br/>A couple of other red flags we saw when it comes to Eva AI Chatbot. One, they don't meet our Minimum Security Standards as we can't confirm your personal information is "
"encrypted well, we were able to log on with the weak password of \"1111\", and we couldn't confirm if they have a way to manage security vulnerabilities. The other red flag is their AI itself. We "
"found no transparency into how their AI works to get to know you and communicate with you, no way that you as the user might be able to control that AI if it were to say, become abusive or harmful, "
"and we also couldn't find any information about how your chats are used to train their AI and if you can opt out of this."

"All in all, Eva AI chatbot feels pretty creepy with how it really pushes users to share tons of personal information, even if their privacy policy seems to be one of the better ones we reviewed. "
"What's the worst that could happen? Well, now is a good time to remind users of Eva -- or any AI chatbot -- that they are designed to get you to share lots and lots of sensitive personal information"
" about yourself. And just because their privacy policy says they aren't sharing or selling that information far and wide now, doesn't mean that privacy policy couldn't change in the future. Eva AI "
"Chatbot's privacy policy clearly states, <i>\"We reserve the right to replace, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at its own discretion. It is your responsibility to review this page and check for "
"any Privacy Policy updates.\"</i> As with all things on the internet, once you've shared your personal information out into the world, there is no getting it back. It's probably good to remember "
"that before you tell Eva too much about your deepest desires."
