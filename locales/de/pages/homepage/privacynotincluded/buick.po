"Buick is an American car brand owned by parent company General Motors. Started back in 1899, Buick was once famous for their wood paneled station wagons that took families on epic road trips in the "
"1970s and 80s. Today's Buick models include the Encore, Enclave, and Envista. The <a id=\"a1\">myBuick app</a> lets users do remote car things like start and stop, lock and unlock your car, honk the"
" horn, and check and see how much gas you have left in the tank. General Motors and Buick also offer OnStar connected services (OnStar is the OG connected car service, first offered way back in "
"1996) for things like automatic crash response and stole vehicle assistance. So, how is Buick, their OnStar connected services, and General Motors at privacy? Not very good, unfortunately."

"If your idea of a good time is to search out and read many, many, many various privacy statements, well, Buick's parent company General Motors' privacy landscape is for you! (At least for folks in "

"companies to disclose more of what they are collecting on you, who they are sharing it with, and for what purposes than anywhere else). Yeesh GM! Maybe take a little of that money you have and build"

"Here's the thing. GM really, really wants you to connect to their cars with your phone and use their connected services. It makes them money, so of course they want that. In fact, earlier in 2023 "
"they started <a id=\"a1\">adding $1,500 onto the sticker price</a> of some GM cars for three years of their OnStar and Connected Services Premium Plan. They <a id=\"a2\">call this an \"option\"</a> "
"on the sticker, but turns out, <a id=\"a3\">it's really not much of an option</a>. Car buyers don't have a choice but to pay that $1,500 for the OnStar connected services \"option\" and even if they"
" choose not connect and use the OnStar connected service, they still have to pay that $1,500. One <a id=\"a4\">article</a> we read called this a \"forced option\" and well, that doesn't sound like "
"much of an option to us. On top of that, OnStar's privacy policy says they collect a whole lot of personal information and car data on you and use it for things like marketing and more. Even worse, "
"it seems <a id=\"a5\">GM and OnStar have a fairly close relationship with law enforcement</a> and government, including the US's ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement) agency. It has been reported "
"they turn over location data to law enforcement often."

"And GM does say they can collect a <b>whole lot</b> of data on your through your car, the <a id=\"a1\">myBuick app</a>, and those OnStar connected services. Their privacy policies say they can "
"collect everything from your name, address, geolocation data, characteristics such as age, race, color religion, medical conditions, physical or mental disabilities, sex, gender identify, pregnancy,"
" medical conditions, sexual orientation, genetic, physiological, behavioral, and biological characteristics such as, fingerprints, faceprints, and voiceprints, iris or retina scans, keystroke, gait,"
" or other physical patterns, and sleep, health, or exercise data, audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information. Sooo much information. And that's just the information they "
"say they might collect about you. Then there's the information they say they can collect on your car and driving habits, including <i>license plate number, vehicle identification number (VIN), "
"geolocation, route history, driving schedule, speed, vehicle direction (heading), audio or video information such as information collected from camera images and sensor data, voice command "

"Another thing that concerns us is the issue of consent. Just when do you consent for GM to collect all this data? Is it when you buy the car (because we're pretty sure no one is reading privacy "
"policies then). Perhaps when you connect your phone to your car? Yeah, most people probably aren't reading privacy policies then either. We read an article where a GM executive states, \"Nothing "
"happens without customer consent.\" But what does that consent really look like? Remember, it took your intrepid privacy researchers a full day to try and sort through GM's many, many privacy "
"policies. Are consumers really understanding what they sign up for when the buy a car with OnStar or download and connect the app? We'd sure like to see GM (and all car companies) make sure "

"What's the worst that could happen as you drive around in your Buick with OnStar and the myBuick app? Well,<a id=\"a1\"> based on report</a>s of how OnStar location and other information is shared "
"with law enforcement and government to track people, that gets kinda scary to think about if you live in a US state that bans abortion and wants to track people traveling to other states for their "
"reproductive health care. That's bad. Or if you live in a country where the government could decide they want to track you down for any reason at all. That's also bad. Thinking about the potential "
"for government tracking and controlling of any connected car -- not just GM's -- can get scary fast. Here's hoping regulators step up soon and work to put measures in place to protect people from "
