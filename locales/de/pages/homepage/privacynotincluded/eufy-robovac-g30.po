"Purposeful, powerful, and proficient! That's the promise of Eufy's little robot vacuum. Eufy says it comes with \"smart dynamic navigation 2.0,\" hard hitting suction, and BoostIQ tech to suck even "
"harder when you need it to suck even harder. So much sucking! Unfortunately, the basic RoboVac G30 doesn’t have the best boundaries. It is not compatible with boundary strips. However, the RoboVac "
"G30 Edge offers boundary strip detection and will respect “off limits'' areas like the messy bundle of cords behind your television. It's good to have boundaries."

"This robot vacuum from Eufy doesn’t have a built in camera, instead it maps and navigates your home using 9 infrared sensors. Sensors are generally a<a id=\"a1\"> safer bet than cameras</a> in your "

"users to strangers from their security cams. Eufy said the glitch happened during a software update and “users were able to access video feeds from other users’ cameras.” Eufy said in a <a "
