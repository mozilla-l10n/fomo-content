"Ah, Lex. The once simple lesbian, bisexual, and trans focused text-based anti-dating dating app has changed. Sometimes change is good...sometimes it's not. In the <a id=\"a1\">case of Lex</a>, well,"
" if you're a queer person looking for community, change is good. If you're a queer person looking for sexy romance, maybe change isn't so good. What was once a simple, text-based personal ads that "
"harkened back to ads found in lesbian erotica publication <i>On Our Backs,</i> has<a id=\"a2\"> evolved</a> into a community based <i>\"vibrant social platform.\"</i> Of course, that evolution "

"Thank goodness for Lex. This global queer community app is the only dating app we reviewed in 2024 to earn our Best Of distinction. Phew! Now because of a <a id=\"a1\">recent redesign</a>, the app "

"Besides your login, Lex will collect registration basics like your name, email, preferred pronouns, and username. That’s pretty standard stuff. In case it’s not clear in the app, that means you "
