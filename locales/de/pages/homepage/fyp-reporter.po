"That’s why in 2020, Mozilla built <a id=\"a1\">RegretsReporter</a>: a browser extension for <a id=\"a2\">studying YouTube’s recommender system</a>, powered by more than 22,000 people who donated "
"their data. The extension allowed us to study YouTube recommendations on an unprecedented scale by relying on a data donation methodological approach."

"Building on that success, Mozilla’s <a id=\"a1\">Open Source Research &amp; Investigations team</a> is creating new tools for studying tech platforms through data donation – a kind of community "
"science research. Our studies about YouTube were limited to the browser and so we weren’t able to study how people were using the platform on their phones. Now, we have a new way to conduct "
"crowdsourced research on mobile – where most people actually use these platforms."

"Participants can make a screen recording of their TikTok sessions as they browse their For You Page or otherwise navigate the app. We have developed a privacy-preserving automated analysis system "
