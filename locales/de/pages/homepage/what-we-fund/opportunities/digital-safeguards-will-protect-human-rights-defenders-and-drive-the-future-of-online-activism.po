"Governments in the region have already demonstrated willingness to use digital censorship as a tool to suppress dissent, particularly during politically sensitive periods such as elections or "
"protests. In Kenya for example, the government has <a id=\"a1\">shut down</a> the internet during moments of unrest, often claiming that it is necessary for national security among other reasons."

"In response to these challenges, there will be an increased need for counter cybersecurity measures to protect the safety and privacy of those involved in human rights work in East Africa. Digital "

"Therefore, the ability of technologists to provide human rights defenders with knowledge and digital tools they can use to safeguard themselves from the ever increasing threat of government "
"censorship and surveillance will be critical in determining whether digital activism in the region can thrive in an increasingly hostile environment or if governments will succeed in suppressing the"
" digital rights of their citizens."
