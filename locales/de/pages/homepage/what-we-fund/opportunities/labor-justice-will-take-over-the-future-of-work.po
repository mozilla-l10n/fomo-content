"Technology has in many ways disrupted work as we knew it. The Covid-19 pandemic shifted our understanding of work, and the localisation of work meant that it could be done remotely. The rise and "
"rise of platforms also allowed for jobs that could be performed with a degree of flexibility. Artificial Intelligence is growing so fast that we do not have a glimpse of its supply chain, and it is "
"also changing expectations of productivity in many types of workplace."

"This growing tech-enabled workforce – which chooses their working hours, and can even be their own boss – has been dressed up in fancy new terms. No longer ‘employee’ but ‘partner’, ‘independent "
"contractor’. While I am excited by the optionality that tech has brought to workers, the degree of autonomy it can offer and the ways that women have been integrated into traditionally male roles "
"such as taxi drivers, this work has also increased the precarity of labor, increased mental stress and continues to run on an unsustainable model. New labor language doesn’t cover how capital is "
"profiting from tech-mediated workers more than ever."

"But workers are rising– uniting across different sectors to reclaim their dignity, their sanity and to make themselves seen and heard. Multinational technology companies have been challenged by "
"content moderators for alleged <a id=\"a1\">union busting techniques</a> and unfair dismissals. E-hailing drivers have <a id=\"a2\">downed their tools</a> on several occasions and in many cases "
"brought the city of Nairobi to a halt. Workers are coming together with key stakeholders taking on their agency to organise. Ironically, they often organize using the same technologies that are "
"making their work lives more unjust."

"<a id=\"a1\">Research</a> shows that youth, who are mostly affected by precarity, are demanding decent tech work. And that the future of ‘digital work’ should be rooted in fair working conditions. "
"In August 2024, [Kenyan youth leadership group] Siasa Place, in collaboration with [German feminist group] Superrr Lab, held an exchange programme for workers based in Germany and Kenya where they "
"built upon a workers’ manifesto to put their demands for labor justice."

"In 2025, worker action for labor standards that take account of technology’s harmful effects will grow louder and more widely adopted. They will also evolve, because these new and emergent forms of "
"work are not homogenous. Some conditions –such as low wages and lack of social protections – are uniform. However, a content moderator concerned about mental strain is different from a location-"
"based e-hailing delivery rider worried about the unpredictable and unbearable weather patterns caused by climate change."

"Moreover, there is a lot of pushback. Legislations that aims to<a id=\"a1\"> protect</a> multinational technology companies has been tabled in Kenya . Workers must therefore organise in their "
"respective sectors and collectively. Unions and Civil Society Organisations should also play their active role in raising worker voices, as this is a fundamental moment in history that will shape "
"the future of work."
