"The need to harmonize governance ambitions with technical realities will become undeniable in 2025. The Internet’s foundational protocols have long enabled interoperability, stability, and security "
"across networks, providing the platform for its remarkable growth. Yet, as technological complexities increase, the gap between governance and protocol infrastructure has widened. While regulations "
"might seek to prevent AI bias or protect personal data, such rules are often undermined by the absence of AI-related technical standards. In the future, strong, adaptable protocols will be the "
"backbone of effective governance, transforming policies from aspirations into enforceable realities."

"Through my years of experience working on digital governance, I have witnessed firsthand the complexities of bridging policymaking with technological innovation. For instance, current discourse at "
"various internet governance fora clearly indicates that a significant number of stakeholders expect the <a id=\"a1\">Global Digital Compact</a> to address human rights and sustainable development "
"alongside the rapid pace of digital innovation. However, even with such a global framework, the Internet's transformative power cannot be fully leveraged without advancing the technical protocols "
"that underpin its operation. Undoubtedly governance frameworks are crucial, but their impact will remain limited unless reinforced by robust Internet protocols."

"A number of organizations have made efforts to increase transparency, reduce bias, and optimize AI’s interoperability within existing Internet infrastructure. For instance, the Internet Engineering "
"Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have long championed open standards, and their efforts to address AI-related challenges have recently gained momentum. These include "
"tackling issues like AI-driven interactions, the integration of AI into the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, including standardizing preferences for AI-related content usage, and improving the "
"efficiency of edge computing to handle AI services closer to users. Other issues include the application of human-centric AI standards, targeting ethical challenges such as transparency, privacy, "
"and the environmental impact of AI technologies. AI-generated content, developing reporting frameworks for AI models, and advocating for decentralized architectures that empower users to control "
"their data, has also been a key focus."

"However, these efforts remain insufficient when matched against the breadth of AI’s influence. Organizations are continuously grappling with systemic risks like misinformation and impersonation, "
"credential management and identity verification. The limited scope and reach of current protocols reveal a deeper issue: governance, no matter how comprehensive, cannot succeed without technical "
"standards that enact its principles. This disconnect has a historical precedent. Twenty years after the creation of the Internet Governance Forum in 2005, the misalignment between regulatory "
"approaches and rapidly evolving technical standards has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem where policies struggle to gain traction. The governance of AI will repeat these same mistakes unless "
"technical protocols are prioritized alongside regulatory frameworks."

"Addressing the challenges posed by AI is actually a shining opportunity. Regulation is an important first step, but integrating protocol development into governance strategies will not only address "
"AI-specific challenges but also tackle the Internet’s long-standing systemic issues. By embracing this dual approach, we can pave the way for a digital future that is secure, inclusive, and "
"resilient, ensuring that technological progress aligns with societal values and global equity."
