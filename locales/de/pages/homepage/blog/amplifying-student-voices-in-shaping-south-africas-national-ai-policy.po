"Engaging with the policy material, students were encouraged to reach out to their peers, analyze the document critically, and provide insightful feedback. IT Society student leaders, Arehone Matodzi"

"community, and a broader network of stakeholders. Matodzi acknowledged that <i>“Most students didn't even know that there was a framework out and welcomed the opportunity to engage in the "

"Through their engagement with the AI policy, students raised critical concerns about the framework’s ability to address the country’s skills gap. One of their main flags was the framework’s "
"limitations in adequately outlining how the government plans to make AI-related skills more accessible. They noted that AI courses in South African universities are not comprehensive enough and "
"struggle to keep pace with global innovations in the field."

"For AI adoption to be truly effective, there must be a clear, actionable plan that demonstrates how AI will impact industries and the lives of South Africans, “<i>It isn't merely a case of us just "

"Another critical point raised by the students was the lack of focus on public AI literacy within the framework. While the policy addresses the development of AI and risk mitigation, there is less "

"South Africa’s history of student activism is rich and deeply intertwined with the country's broader struggle for social justice, most notably during the apartheid era. Today, the students at UWC "

"also inclusive and accessible to all."

"Indeed, the government must prioritize collaboration and engagement with varying stakeholders including student organizations, ensuring that their voices are heard and their contributions are valued"
" in policy dialogues. Gretchen Adams, Youth Coordinator for RCCSA notes “<i>In a society whose history is deeply entrenched in social and economic inequality and disparities that are still prevalent"
" today, it is pivotal that the South African approach to technological policy development is inclusive and equitable. Inclusion alone does not translate into equity - everyone can be included in key"
" policy discussions. Still, it is normally the powerful and those with influence that take center stage, leaving the marginalized and underserved without a voice. This is particularly the case with "
"youth voices that get easily lost amongst varying interest groups, it is, therefore, important to elevate the underrepresented but most impacted to the fore in public engagement, policy development,"
" and intervention planning”.</i>"
