"In addition to the toll it takes for computers to process all this info, Lorena points out that creating the computers themselves comes at a cost too. “The extraction of minerals like lithium, "
"cobalt, and rare earth elements for technology components often occurs in regions with environmental and social concern,” says Lorena. “These issues disproportionately impact marginalized "
"communities, particularly in the Global South, where mining operations can harm local ecosystems and communities.”"
