"The ChatGPT creator Open AI is making deepfake detection software and for now — like its <a id=\"a1\">AI-generated video tool Sora</a> — it’s releasing it only to a handful of early testers. The "
"deepfake detector tool will look for metadata hidden within images made by OpenAI’s Dall-E 3. Metadata are usually points like an MP3’s song title or location data attached to a photo. In this case "
"it’s information revealing whether a file was made by AI or not. Metadata When the Sora video tool is released, those videos <a id=\"a2\">will also contain</a> the same sort of metadata."

"In <a id=\"a1\">recent research from Mozilla</a>, we found that current technologies for helping internet users distinguish synthetic content — like watermarking and labeling — can’t reliably "
"identify undisclosed synthetic content. <a id=\"a2\">Newer examinations</a> of AI detection tools have led to the same result. In the case of OpenAI’s tool, the company appears confident that its "
"tool can detect AI dupes created using OpenAI software.The answer lies within the metadata. OpenAI says it can identify AI-made images from its DALL-E model <a id=\"a3\">98.8</a> percent of the "
"time, thanks to the metadata hidden within the photo. Even though it’s usually easy to edit a file’s metadata, OpenAI claims the metadata attached to the resulting file in this case is “<a "
"id=\"a4\">tamper-resistant</a>.” At the very least, the method appears more tamper-resistant than adding a watermark to the bottom right of a photo or video."
