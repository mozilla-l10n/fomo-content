"remember something. Conversely, if you want to make sure ChatGPT doesn’t remember something, you can use the <a id=\"a2\">Temporary Chat</a> feature. On top of that, you can archive chats or full-on"
" delete chats, which removes that conversation from OpenAI servers after <a id=\"a3\">30 days</a>. (It’s worth noting that OpenAI can share your personal info with <a id=\"a4\">law enforcement</a> "

"Your first option is the <a id=\"a1\">Temporary Chat</a> feature. When Temporary Chat is switched on, OpenAI says anything you type won’t be added to memory, won’t be used to train the AI model and "
"mostly won’t live in your history (OpenAI potentially holds onto the chat for 30 days for “safety purposes”). Another option is <a id=\"a2\">changing your settings</a> so that your ChatGPT queries "
"aren’t used to train OpenAI’s models or log any history. You can do that by going to Settings then Show Data Controls and switching Chat History &amp; Training to the off position. Both, presumably,"
