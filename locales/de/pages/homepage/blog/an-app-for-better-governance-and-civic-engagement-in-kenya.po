"Kenya’s public debt rose to a record <a id=\"a1\">total of 10.1 trillion shillings ($70.75 billion) in 2023</a>, breaching the national debt ceiling. Treasury officials attribute the skyrocketing "
"debt to exchange and interest rate fluctuations on loan repayments and inflation, among other factors, but critics cite years of governmental <a id=\"a2\">corruption and financial mismanagement</a> "
"spanning different political administrations. Additionally, Kenyans have been scarred by a history of election-related violence; <a id=\"a3\">1,200 people were reported killed in the aftermath of "
"the 2007 general election,</a> and more than 100 died in 2017 post-election clashes. The 2017 and 2022 general elections were also <a id=\"a4\">marred by the spread of online disinformation</a>, "
"some of which exploited and exacerbated entrenched ethnic tensions."

"TISA’s Jihusishe mobile app is still under development, but users can access it through both smartphones and on web browsers through other connected devices. The app is meant to facilitate "
"communication between citizens and government officials, connect citizens with each other, and provide current, accurate information about government projects, laws, policies, and proposals. People "
"can use Jihusishe to report concerning incidents or complaints, and receive a tracking ID to follow up on their progress. Jihusishe may also offer people a virtual and improved type of Baraza (or "
"council) meeting. Traditional Baraza meetings are informal, in-person gatherings where community members discuss issues affecting them, but they often lack a clear set of steps to help people "
"present requests to the relevant officials. Using Jihusishe can allow people to move some of these discussions online, offering a structured way of escalating requests and grievances to the right "
"sources and providing a direct channel between citizens and elected leaders."

"The Jihusishe app is designed to provide people with the information they need to hold their elected officials accountable. “It’s meant to guide people on what to do with the information they find "
"to improve governance,” Project Coordinator Diana Gichengo said. TISA has already used Jiusishe’s SMS system to send out one-way messages meant to help quell potential violence during Kenya’s 2017 "
"general elections, targeting people in high-risk areas including Nakuru, Nandi, and Kisumu counties where tensions threatened to boil over."
