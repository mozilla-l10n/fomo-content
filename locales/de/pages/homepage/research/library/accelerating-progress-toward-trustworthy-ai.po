"Mozilla’s work on AI is not new – we’ve been funding, building and advocating for trustworthy AI approaches for years. In 2020, we published a <a id=\"a1\">white paper</a> that outlined our vision "
"for trustworthy AI in a nascent moment for the technology. Since then, a lot has changed. Today, AI is increasingly powerful and pervasive in our society, and its promise and perils are becoming "
"even more apparent. While there are a growing number of individuals and organizations working on making AI more trustworthy, the scope of the challenge is also continuing to grow. And while we’ve "
"made progress on advancing guardrails for AI systems, the AI ecosystem has also become increasingly closed and concentrated."

"Given the rapid changes in AI recently, we felt there was a need to take stock of the progress we’ve made so far and the work that is left to do. This new report provides an update on work to date "
"in the four strategic areas we outlined in our 2020 paper, and it maps key initiatives happening in these areas – both at Mozilla and across the ecosystem. Importantly, the paper also emphasizes our"
" evolving focus on the centrality of open source in the development of more trustworthy AI. We hope this report will be both a guidepost and map — helping readers to articulate their own strong "
"message on trustworthy AI, build and invest in a better future for AI, and find opportunities to collaborate with others in the AI ecosystem. In turn, we believe our collective work can set us on a "
"path to truly advance openness, competition, and accountability in AI."
