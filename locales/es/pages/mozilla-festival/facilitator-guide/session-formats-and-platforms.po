"While a lot of sessions at MozFest take place on <a id=\"a1\">Zoom</a>, there are many different platforms and tools that Facilitators can use. These platforms are paid for and managed by the "
"Mozilla Foundation and there is no cost for your use during MozFest. Keep in mind, you can suggest alternative platforms for your sessions in your proposal, however it is essential that you provide "
"guidance during your session so that your participants will be comfortable with them."
