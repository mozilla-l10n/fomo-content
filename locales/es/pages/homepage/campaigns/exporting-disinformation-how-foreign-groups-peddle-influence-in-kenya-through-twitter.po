"In 2020, the <a id=\"a1\">Reproductive Healthcare Bill</a> was tabled in Parliament. It asked Kenyan politicians to vote to “provide a framework for the right to reproductive healthcare and the "
"decisions regarding them and to set the standards of reproductive health.” The bill sought to outlaw forced sterilizations and make prenatal, delivery and postnatal services free to every woman in "
"the country. It made clear that everyone is entitled to reproductive healthcare services, including adolescents. Almost immediately, anti-abortion campaigners launched objections, calling it “<a "
"id=\"a2\">The Abortion Bill.</a>” Additionally, they claimed the bill opened the way for legalized abortion and use of contraceptives among adolescents."

"However, Twitter did not respond to questions about what partnerships they may have with civil society organizations and public health institutions in Kenya. They also didn’t respond to questions "

"It's worth mentioning, however, that if the COVID pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that the internet is rife with health misinformation. Health is a political topic and sometimes the source of "
"this problem is the medical establishment itself. This makes it a tremendously tough problem for platforms to referee, and social media companies traditionally have no subject matter expertise to "
"tackle health misinformation. Twitter’s current approach to health misinformation is a patchwork of policies that are sometimes only invoked when <a id=\"a1\">there is public attention or "
"pressure</a>. There is more that Twitter can be doing. Researcher Kenneth Juma of APHRC called upon platforms like Twitter to go beyond low hanging fruit solutions, stating: “Beyond labeling, these "
"platforms can delete outrightly false information and ban superspreaders of false information.”"

"Bearing in mind our findings and the upcoming Kenyan election in 2022, we are concerned that Twitter’s platform manipulation policies and even their enforcement have not been enough to address how "
"paid political influence occurs on the platform. Even after sharing our evidence with Twitter, and Twitter suspending the accounts, <a id=\"a1\">yet another campaign emerged</a> just before we "
