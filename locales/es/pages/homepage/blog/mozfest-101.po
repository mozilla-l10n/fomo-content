"However, the program itself is curated and scheduled by volunteer community organizers called <a id=\"a1\"><b>Wranglers</b></a><b>.</b> Mozilla uses a community nomination process each year that "
"invites past organizers to suggest new Wranglers for the next festival. With support from Mozilla, these Wranglers meet weekly for months leading up to the festival and typically attend an "
"intensive, in-person, week-long planning retreat. Most recently, Wranglers came together for smaller amounts of time online for their onboarding process. They create the different spaces (kind of "
"like tracks) at the festival, select the sessions for each space, schedule the sessions, support all of the Facilitators running sessions at the festival, and design and build the actual physical "
"spaces onsite. Spaces are sometimes themed after specific internet health issues, like “Digital Inclusion” or “Openness,” and sometimes themed after particular communities and experiences, like the "
"Gaming, Neurodiversity, and Queering spaces. However, Wranglers have a lot of freedom to re-interpret and invent Spaces each year."
