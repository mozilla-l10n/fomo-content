"<i>How can we harness the power of collective and emerging knowledge for a healthier internet?</i> Blogging around MozFest can be a fabulous provocation to activate this while expanding your work "

"celebration of engaging your community’s unique voice in global dialogues across time zones and languages; and much more. You can make the most out of other communication media you feel more "
"comfortable with, such as podcasts, videos, illustrations and theater. However, writing is often connected as well to the creation process of these alternatives."

"I started my blog in 2020 as a result of taking part in <a id=\"a1\">Mozilla's Internet Health Report</a> for which people from around the world were invited to showcase their perspectives on "
"healthy and unhealthy moments from that year. For the unhealthy moment I noted Uruguay’s legislation on Data Protection being based on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, yet "
"excluding its specific considerations for children. No one had written about it, so I dedicated my first blog article to elaborate on this topic and be <a id=\"a2\">featured on the IHR</a>."

"Although I had prior experience with academic articles, I was hesitant about starting a blog and doubted the value of voicing my opinions. The IHR made me aware of this steep gap in information on "
"Uruguay’s data protection legislation and was the perfect call to action. Ever since unlocking this practice I’ve been writing blogs regularly, introspecting about the main takeaways from my digital"
" education projects and openly sharing its resources. I decode blogging as an opportunity to (a) write shorter texts in a more approachable style, (b) expanding this with links to academic, "
"traditional media outlets, and long reads, (c) complementing them with multimedia resources such as slide images, podcasts, videos and session recordings. I generally publish in both English and "
"Spanish. English has been the dominant language around human rights in the digital age. Blogging in different languages has allowed me to mobilise conversations across English and Spanish-speaking "
"communities."
