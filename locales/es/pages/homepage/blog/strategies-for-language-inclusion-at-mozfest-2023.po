"I’m sure the first thing that came to mind when you read the headline was “translation”. That was the case for us too, until we realized there were many ways language inclusion can, and should, "
"count on other strategies too. It is not about putting translation aside (that would be impossible), but rather aiming at creating –as well as co-creating– different spaces in different languages. "
"At MozFest, we are thinking about welcoming different speakers in different ways."

"Last time we spoke about <a id=\"a1\">constellations</a>: we want to think about different strategies that can connect with one another and create a support system for Facilitators to expand their "
"work and their ideas. There are many ways to do this, and we will certainly think of many more as we get closer to the start of the festival thanks to everything that our Facilitators bring to the "
"table."

"Each session is different, and each team has a style of its own, of course. So, to start thinking about each Facilitator’s “constellations,” or support system for language inclusion, here are some "
"of the strategies we believe can help to expand the ideas behind a session and welcome as many people as possible."
