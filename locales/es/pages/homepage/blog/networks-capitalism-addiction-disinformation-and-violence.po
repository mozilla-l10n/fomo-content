"Recent revelations from Facebook whistleblower confirm what scholars and technologists have argued for a while: monetization imperatives shape functions and forms of incumbent social networks, which"
" in turn are leading to antidemocratic processes. These range from the amplification of hate and disinformation, to hyperpolarization, to anti-scientific theories that have regained followers and "
"even violence spinning off to the offline world."

"In Latin-America, people spend 3h30 per day on social networks, the highest average across all regions. As such, the region is particularly affected by the challenges posed by social media, and has "
"witnessed issues such as rampant misinformation about Venezuelan migrants and refugees, to the rise of technopopulism in Brazil. In the context of Covid-19, research suggests that Latin-Americans "
"were particularly prone to misinformation related to health (e.g. social isolation, vaccine uptake) circulating in platforms."

"Based on a selection including two documentaries, one fiction-movie and one book chapter, we will dive into questions such as: does data monetization imply addiction? How is social media weaponized "

"Despite impressive engagement metrics (4.2 billion users in the world in 2021), incumbent social platforms are not designed to support deeper discussion that require nuance and attention (instead of"
" clickbait). On the contrary, their addictive immediacy together with algorithms that optimize user engagement KPIs, have favored the superficial consumption of information. Today, as Richard "
"Seymour puts it: “to inhabit social media is to be in a state of constant distractedness, a junkie fixation on keeping in touch with it”."

"Recent studies, illustrate the danger of constant distractedness, suggesting that misinformation is often shared because of failure “to think sufficiently about whether or not the content is "
"accurate”. These dynamics foster a negative impact chain, since the use of social media for news is associated with being ‘politically engaged on social media’, which in turn is associated with "
"being more likely to “share inaccurate claims regarding governmental affairs, science, and natural disasters”."
