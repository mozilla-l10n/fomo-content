"Yes. I’m telling you I’m a language nerd without telling you I’m a language nerd. However, in communities like ours, in which languages expand, mix and come together to share ideas and find common "

"And so, while reflecting on last year’s <a id=\"a1\">Mozilla Festival</a> and how it could be more language inclusive, we started dipping our toes in the multilingual water, thinking about "
"translation assistance and ways to have sessions in more than one language. We quickly realized language inclusion had to be about more, a lot more, than simply making content available in English "
"if people decided to speak their own languages in their sessions. Many questions filled our heads as we began to dream:"

"Throughout this learning journey, we realized that language inclusion is as much about communicating and strategizing as it is about language itself. It’s not just one thing, and it is not all "
"language. Language inclusion is very much about <b>bringing the Mozilla Festival outside and beyond the virtual walls of the Mozilla Festival</b>. That is: <b>organizing conversations after the "
"festival</b>, <b>creating content through different media</b> and above all <b>creating safe spaces. This is</b> so that whatever language we choose to tell our story, <a id=\"a1\">we feel free "
"telling it</a> and <a id=\"a2\">we have fun doing it</a>. We left behind ideas around single methods and embraced thinking in terms of constellations, or a group of ideas and experiments that all "
"have a common thread: language inclusion. All in all, we learned that thinking about languages within the festival is a process made of many connected dots made of team organization, community "
"participation, crowdfunded efforts and lots, (lots!) of creativity."

"We experimented with <b>multilingual teams</b>, <b>translation of written materials</b>, <b>parallel sessions, working with video/audio</b> and <b>language appropriation</b> (in many cases, "
"<i>English appropriation</i>): learning to feel confident speaking a language that is not your first, forgetting about colonial conventions that end in exclusion and loving how you sound in it, and "
"daring to add your own touches."

"The experiment continues this year; we’re taking these learnings from MozFest 2022 and running with it all for 2023 and beyond. This is no less than a full scale mission, and our first step forward "
"<b>will be in Spanish</b>. MozFest is encouraging Spanish speakers to bring their ideas, their sessions and their communities to the festival. This will open the door to more ideas, more strategies,"
" and hopefully, more languages."
