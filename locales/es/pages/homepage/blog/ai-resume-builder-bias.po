"The answer is yes, you can use AI to write your resume. Reviews from folks like <a id=\"a1\">Tom’s Guide</a> and <a id=\"a2\">TechRadar</a> show that tools like <a id=\"a3\">Kickresume</a> and <a "

"Alia ElKattan is a PhD student at New York University, studying the implications of online platforms. Alia is also one of the three creators of <a id=\"a1\">Survival Of The Best Fit</a>, a game "

"“Applicants can utilize AI-based tools to make the job search less insufferable and time-consuming, but should remember that the outputs are often not only vague and generic, but also are not "
"necessarily accurate or reliable,” says Alia. It’s important to remember that relying solely on AI could make your resume appear cookie-cutter — for better or worse. Alia recommends still adding "
"that unique flair. “When making use of AI software, applicants need to make sure to use them in limited ways that complement their own work, assessment, and review, rather than completely replacing "
"their input and perspective.”"

"When it comes to AI’s use in the hiring process, the pitfalls are all too glaring. “Applicants from underrepresented groups are at risk of getting filtered out at various stages of the hiring "
"process because their profiles and experiences may not match the ones most commonly present in training data,” says Alia. “A common rebuttal is that employers could just build programs that do not "
"read or retain your age, gender, race, etc. — identifiers that typically aren't even on a CV — but it's more complicated than that. Sometimes the trends an algorithm picks up on aren’t as explicit "
"as those literal demographic identifiers. It can be as subtle as the kinds of jobs or extracurricular activities a person has on their resume. Or even the universities that tend to include (or "
"exclude) certain groups.”"

"In a world where ChatGPT can write all your emails and Sora can fabricate a woman walking down a Tokyo street <a id=\"a1\">in HD</a>, AI software probably has a not-so-hard time drafting up your "

"“The use of AI should always, at the very least, be paired with oversight and intentionality,” says Alia. “If employers are using AI to search for candidates, are they investigating where that "
"search leads to, and based on what? What are these algorithms trained to pick up on, and what platforms or avenues is it searching through? For candidates, it may be less consequential, but it's "
"still important to remember that the same AI software you use to build your application may be used by many others. As such, its output can tend to be repetitive and generic, which is generally not "
"a strong way to stand out in the job market.”"
