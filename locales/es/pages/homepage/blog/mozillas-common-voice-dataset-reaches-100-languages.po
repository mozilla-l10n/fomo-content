"Changing this trajectory is a pool of motivated language community builders like Daniel Agyeman, a contributor to Common Voice. This endeavor is one that reconnects him with his culture: “I was born"

"improve my Twi speaking skills. Currently, I have not come across any usage of Twi in voice technology, therefore I was very excited at the prospect of creating a Twi voice dataset which can be used"
" to create the first ever speech recognition system in Twi.’’"

"contributions.<br/><br/>Through the support of the Gates Foundation, NVIDIA, and GIZ, the 11th <a id=\"a1\">Common Voice dataset</a> release is set to exceed 23,000 hours. This community-driven "
