"Sony's PS5 has been around since 2020 and demand is still so high it's tough to buy one. The PS5 comes in both a regular edition with a disc drive and the cheaper digital edition without the drive. "
"Beefed up power and high-quality graphical output make games like God of War Ragnarok, Horizon Forbidden West, and Marvel's Spiderman: Miles Morales, fast and beautiful. All that, and they aren't "

"Not gonna lie, this privacy researcher loves her PS5. I also recognize it collects and shares lots of information on me. Things like name, email, phone number, location, and lots and lots of device "
