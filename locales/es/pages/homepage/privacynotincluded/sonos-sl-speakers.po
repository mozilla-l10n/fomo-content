"Sonos took their Sonos One and Roam smart speakers and made them dumb. Seems there is a market for privacy-minded people who just want a speaker for playing music, not with a built-in microphone "
"that can listen to you. The Sonos One SL and Roam SL are just like their smart speaker counterparts, minus the microphone listening for voice commands from Sonos Voice Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or "
"Google Assistant. Control it with the Sonos app or use Apple Airplay to stream your music. Just think, a speaker built to play music and not listen to you all day long. Crazy!"

"Sonos’ One SL and Roam SL are very good privacy-minded speakers. They have no built-in microphone to listen, record, or send data back to Sonos, Amazon or Google. So not a whole lot can go wrong. "
"And Sonos does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a whole."

"What’s the worst that could happen with the Sonos’ smart speakers? All in all, there’s not a lot that can go wrong with this speaker in your house because it’s, well, it’s really just a speaker. We "
"suppose you could listen to that new Taylor Swift album on repeat through Sonos Radio. And then Sonos could know you’re a huge Swifty and from there assumes you’re probably also interested in rom "
"coms and then you get targeted with ads for all the rom coms everywhere when you actually hate rom coms. In our crazy world today where privacy feels like a thing of the past, this actually feels "
"like a pretty quaint worst case scenario. We think you’re probably fairly safe with Sonos’ SL speakers."
