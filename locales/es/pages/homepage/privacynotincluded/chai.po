"Chai AI boasts over one million AI chatbot personalities (go ahead, say that with your pinky finger next to your mouth in your best Austin Powers voice!). Download the app (be careful to get the "
"right Chai AI app though, there are some imposters out there), and start swiping and chatting. Free users get a limited number of chats at a time, limiting the app's fun and function. Premium "
"subscriptions start around $14 a month. And according to Chai, they <i>\"obsessively optimize our language models, continually making them more entertaining than ever before.\"</i> So be prepared to"
" get sucked into spending money. Also be prepared to stumble across some weird and creepy chatbots that are both SFW and NSFW and probably not exactly great for your privacy. As one Chai user put in"
" their Apple Store review, <i>\"on the weird ones let's just say it was better to NOT go on them.</i>\" Good luck out there in AI chatbot land people! Careful swiping."

msgid "Three things jumped out at us immediately as we were reviewing the Chai AI chatbot app, beyond some pretty disturbing content we found during our research (seriously, ick!)."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"First, we noticed at the time of our review, Chai's privacy policy was last updated in March, 2021. In the rapidly advancing world of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), it feels to us "
"like having a three year old privacy policy is pretty out of date. Their privacy policy felt too vague and boilerplate to really make us feel certain we understood all of what personal information "
"they are collecting and how they are using it. A quick search of their privacy policy found no mention at all of how they collect and handle the contents of their users' chats. We also could find no"
" specific mention anywhere of how they use any personal information, including sensitive personal information and the contents of chats, to train their AIs. This is all a bit concerning to us, "
"especially for an app designed to have users share lots of personal information."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"We did find some seemingly contradictory information between their <a id=\"a1\">Privacy Policy</a> and their <a id=\"a2\">End User License Agreement</a> (EULA) that left us quite confused. (Privacy "
"researchers really don't like to be confused...we figure if we can't freaking figure it out, how in the heck are consumers supposed to understand this stuff?). Their privacy policy from March, 2021 "
"states, <i>\"We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to "
"be \"selling\" of your personal data.\"</i> However, their EULA document from April, 2023 states, <i>\"By posting your Contributions to any part of the Licensed Application or making Contributions "
"accessible to the Licensed Application by linking your account from the Licensed Application to any of your social networking accounts, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that "
"you have the right to grant, to us an unrestricted, unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, fully-paid, worldwide right, and license to host, use copy, "
"reproduce, disclose, sell, resell, publish, broad cast, retitle, archive, store, cache, publicly display, reformat, translate, transmit, excerpt (in whole or in part), and distribute such "
"Contributions (including, without limitation, your image and voice) for any purpose, commercial advertising, or otherwise, and to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate in other works, such as "
"Contributions, and grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing.\"</i> That is a whole bunch of legalese gobbledygook, but it sure does sound to us like they grant themselves the rights to do "
"whatever they want with your chats on Chai."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"The second thing that really left us scratching our heads when it comes to Chai AI is this line in their privacy policy, <i>\"All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete "
"and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.\"</i> Now, we supposed this makes sense when it comes to sharing your personal information to pay for a subscription"
" -- no lies there. But to require people to consent to a privacy policy for an AI chat app designed for things like role playing, NSFW relationships, and the like, it seems quite odd to us to "
"require people to to always provide true, complete, and accurate personal information. Does this mean no nicknames at sign up? Does this mean you can't lie when you chat with your bot? Does this "
"mean if you change your name and forget to let Chai AI know you're in violation of their privacy policy? It all seems rather odd to us and perhaps like their privacy policy wasn't written with their"
" current services in mind?"

"The third thing that really, <i>really</i> stood out to us was <a id=\"a1\">this story</a> from 2023 about a Chai AI user who committed suicide after a Chai chatbot encouraged the user to kill "
"himself. Yup, when it comes to worst case scenarios with AI chatbots, having one encourage you to kill yourself when you are talking with it about how depressed you are is pretty much right up there"
" at the top. Chai AI <a id=\"a2\">crowdsources</a> many of the models for their AI chatbots and while they do say they have put measures in place to provide \"<i>helpful text\"</i> under what they "
"deem unsafe discussions, this is a very good reminder that the world of AI chatbots, especially ones designed to develop relationships with users, is very much an uncertain arena, a Wild West if you"
" may."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"So, between our uncertainty at the trustworthiness of Chai's AI models, the vague and confusing language we found in their privacy documentation, the fact that their privacy policy doesn't clearly "
"say all uses can delete their data, and the fact that we were unable to determine if Chai AI meets our Minimum Security Standards by confirming they use encryption of your personal information in "
"transit and where it is stored, we have to warn that Chai AI very likely comes with *Privacy Not Included."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "worst_case"
msgid ""
"On that note, we'll leave you with this good reminder from Chai AI's own privacy policy, <i>\"However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over "
"the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be "
"able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.\"</i> A good thing to keep in mind when you use Chai AI or pretty much anything that shares your "
