"Hallow is a Catholic prayer and meditation app launched at the end of 2018. A $60 per year subscription (or $8.99 per month) gives users access to over 500 prayers, 3,500+ meditations, sleep Bible "
"stories, music, sermons, and more. At the end of 2021, Hallow announced <a id=\"a1\">investor funding</a> of over $50 million dollars from some big names in <a id=\"a2\">Silicon Valley venture "
"capital</a>, including Peter Thiel, who recently<a id=\"a3\"> left Facebook/Meta's</a> board to become more involved in politics, supporting candidates who align with Donald Trump's agenda. All in "
"all, Hallow's privacy practices seem to be the best of the five pray apps we reviewed, although they do use users' data for marketing purposes. Hallow seems to particularly be fond of <a "
"id=\"a4\">advertising on Facebook</a>."

"warning label. Hallow also says they will be adding text-message verification code sign up soon too, which is great, as we like <a id=\"a1\">two-factor authentication</a> here at <i>*Privacy Not "

"What's the worst that could happen. Well, you could download and use Hallow and before you know it, you and all your friends and family now see targeted Hallow ads everywhere you go. Soon the guilt "

"Here's hoping that doesn't happen...or that really is the worst thing that happens."
