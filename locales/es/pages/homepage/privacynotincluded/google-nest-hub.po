"If you like the idea of a smart video hub that lets you display your photos, watch YouTube, listen to podcasts, and control you lights with your voice, but you don't want a video camera watching you"
" all the time, this is the gadget for you. Unlike Google's more expensive Nest Hub Max, the Nest Hub has no built-in camera to watch you. So it's perfect for your bedside table. Which is where "
"Google hopes you'll put it so it can do some sleep sensing, a feature Google added that uses motion and sound to monitor your sleep. Wake up every morning and it'll tell you if you slept, when you "
"slept, and how your slept. And it's got three built-in microphones, so maybe switch those and the sleep sensing off when your friend with benefits comes for a visit. Google doesn't need to track "

"You should absolutely take the time to adjust these privacy settings. Just beware, you will get notifications that some things might not work right if you change settings. That’s annoying, and "
