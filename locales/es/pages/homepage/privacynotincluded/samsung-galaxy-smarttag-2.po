"The Galaxy SmartTag is a Bluetooth tracker that also lets you control some of your smart home devices with the click of a button. Cool. Pop this little puppy on your keychain and find your lost keys"

"Samsung's Galaxy SmartTags don't have the huge community network of devices helping track them that Apple's Airtags and Tile's trackers do. But, they’re working on it. In May 2023, they <a "
"id=\"a1\">announced</a> that they added millions of devices to their SmartThings Find network, growing it by 1.5 times since last year. Thankfully, just like other popular trackers, <a "
"id=\"a2\">Samsung has taken</a> some steps to <a id=\"a3\">help scan if an unknown</a> SmartTag is nearby and tracking you, which is good. You should know that this setting has to be <a "
"id=\"a4\">turned on</a>, under \"Unkown Tag Detection,\" then \"Unkown tag alerts.\" Is this the best anti-stalking solution on the market? No. But because Samsung's network is not as vast as "
"AirTags', they're not going to be as effective at long-range tracking. And because they're not as good at long-range tracking, SmartTags probably won't be the product of choice for bad actors."

"Privacy-wise, it sure seems Samsung likes to collect a lot of data on users, not gonna lie (seriously, the <a id=\"a1\">children's data section</a> in their Samsung account privacy policy seems nuts"

"Unfortunately though, Samsung doesn’t make that promise to all its users (even in the US) in their privacy policy. They say those rights are “subject to applicable law” so they’re not guaranteed no "
