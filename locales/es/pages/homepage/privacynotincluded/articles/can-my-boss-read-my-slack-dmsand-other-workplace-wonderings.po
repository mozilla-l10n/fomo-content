"“Can my boss read my Slack messages?” It’s a question as old as time itself (or at least as old as work chat). We expect a certain level of privacy when we talk on any platform. But with more and "
"more digital platforms being used for work comes a new flavour of workplace anxiety: employee surveillance. If you’ve chatted with anyone using apps like Slack or Microsoft Teams or Zoom, you may "
"have wondered who <i>else</i> may be tuned into the conversation as well."

"There’s a good chance your boss can get access to your Slack messages. Admins can <a id=\"a1\">export messages</a> from public channels, but employers on either Slack’s free tier or paid tier need "
"to submit a request to Slack before they can access your private chats. Your boss would have to prove to Slack that you gave them permission, they have a valid legal reason to access the messages, "
"or there’s a “right or requirement [to do so] under applicable laws,” notes a <a id=\"a2\"><i>Vox</i></a> article on the topic. Things get a bit more complicated if you work in certain parts of "
"government or if your employer pays for a higher level plan, where an employer would need to routinely hold onto your messages and other information. Third-party Slack apps like <a "
