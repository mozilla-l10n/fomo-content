"<b>Acquisitions are bad for privacy.</b> Twitter’s purchase by Elon Musk has pushed other acquisitions out of the spotlight. Big tech companies — which are often some of the worst privacy offenders "
"— are gobbling up smaller companies that previously had better privacy practices. For example, iRobot — whose products previously received “Best Of” marks from Mozilla — is pending sale to Amazon. "
"And Google will soon start requiring Google accounts for Fitbit users, following their acquisition of Fitbit in 2021. Meanwhile, products from Amazon, Meta, Samsung, and Verizon have all received "
