"Launched in 2006 and with over 100+ million downloads in the Google Play Store alone, Badoo is one of the most used dating apps in the world. They say it pays to be the \"real, unapologetic you\" on"
" Bumble Inc.-owned Badoo. Before you get going, you might have to prove you're really you -- with a phone number and photo verification. Then, you can message other users to your heart's content, "
"without waiting for a match first. The app's <a id=\"a1\">Screenshot Block</a> feature means your conversation probably won't end up on Reddit (phew!) but also that you can't crowdsource your witty "
"responses by sending screenshots to your friends (not that you would!). Free users get access to most of the app's features like location-based matches, messaging, and video chats. Badoo Premium "
"lets you see who added you to their favorites, see who liked you, and more. So, how is Badoo at privacy. Well, they're actually kinda Bad. Boo! (see what we did there ;-)."

"Hey, here's a good reminder from Badoo! Their privacy policy states that even though they use security measures to protect your data, \"<i>no website or Internet transmission is every completely "
"100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur\"</i>. This is a good reminder that when dating apps that ask you to give up "
"a ton of personal information, there's no guarantee that it will be protected. On that front, Badoo does do better than most: their security and recent track record are OK (although we can't exactly"
" say the same about the Bumble app from their parent company Bumble Inc.). Too bad they will share your personal information for marketing and might not let you delete it if you decide you want to "

" your profile, including photos. There's your messages too -- Badoo's moderators might be able to read those to make sure you're following the rules. Their <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> says, "
"\"<i>We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts (including photos and any other information uploaded onto user profiles) and messages for "
"content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use.\"</i> Gotcha. There's also your biometric information if you do photo verification, which might be required by Badoo. You can also"
" choose to share your geolocation. Like most dating apps, you should know that just providing sensitive information (like your sexual orientation) <a id=\"a2\">counts as</a> <i>\"explicitly "
"consenting\"</i> to Badoo's processing of it. Oh! And if you login with Facebook or decide to link your Instagram account, then both apps can potentially collect more information together. That's "
