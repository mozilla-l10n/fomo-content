"Gather ‘round kids and cute toy enthusiasts, for a tale about a toy from the last millennium. Before smartphones and having the internet at home, there was Tamagotchi: an egg-shaped interactive toy "
"with a few buttons that let you take (digital) care of a surprisingly lovable pixelated blob. Today, that toy is making its triumphant return with some technical improvements that include more "
"character options and access to the Tamaverse! Oooh la la! And unlike most reboots for nostalgic millennials, this one is somehow better than the original. The Tamagotchi has stayed true to its "
"privacy-preserving roots -- so much so that it gets the thumbs up from our discerning researcher."

"Good news, everyone! The Tamagotchi Uni treats your privacy like it’s 1996. Yep, that’s right. You can dive right on in to the Tomaverse at pretty much no risk to your privacy. Dang, it feels good "

"Tamagotchi Uni toy’s privacy policy is short, simple, and free of red flags. Here’s what we love about it: they don’t collect a pinch more personal data than they need to give you access to the "
"game. And not collecting personal information is really the best way to keep it safe. Your IP address and Device ID is as personal as it gets. Even your chosen nickname is only processed on your "
"device, so feel free to let it all hang out there."

"Great privacy does have its downsides though. In their <a id=\"a1\">FAQ</a>, it says that if your Tamagotchi character disappears, it “cannot be recovered.” Sad, but with 33 different characters at "
"the ready, we’re sure you’ll find another UniTama to love."
