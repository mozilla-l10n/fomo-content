"Sixteen body measurements! That's how many things Eufy's high end P2 Pro WiFi and Bluetooth connected smart scale tracks about you. Everything from weight to heart rate, to BMI, to bone mass, muscle"
" mass, and even your scary sounding visceral and subcutaneous fat measurements. Download the <a id=\"a1\">EufyLife app</a> and connect your phone to the scale to see all your measurements and get "
"charts and graphs and a full body report. There's even a baby mode and pet mode to record how fast your furry or not-so-furry kids are growing. Eufy also makes some lower end scales that track "
"similar things. They all use the Eufy Life app that can share your (very) personal data with Fitbit, Google Fit, or Apple Health if you connect the app to those services. Eufy does raise a few red "
"flags for us on the privacy front, so here's hoping all your visceral fat data stays private!"

"According to Eufy’s <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>, they do say they can collect a good deal of personal information on you -- things like name, email, gender, birth date, location, device "
"information, and of course this device collects health data like heart rate, weight, and BMI. And while Eufy says they don’t sell your personal information -- which is good -- they say they can use "
"some of that information to show you ads from them and third party advertisers, which isn’t so good (but also pretty standard on the internet these days)."

"They also say they can collect personal information on you from third parties who provide it to them, such as law enforcement authorities. This worries us a bit because the way that line in their "
"privacy policy is written is rather vague and seems like it could leave open the possibility they could collect information on users from a variety of third parties, for example, data brokers. And "
"finally, Eufy says they can use your personal information to profile you for the purpose of offering you personalized promotions and discounts. So if you get offered a screaming discount for that "
"weight loss plan and your buddy doesn’t, it could be because Eufy knows more about you than you might want them to know."
