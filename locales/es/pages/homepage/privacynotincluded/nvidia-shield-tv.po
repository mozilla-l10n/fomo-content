"If you want an Android TV streaming box with features like Dolby Vision and Atmos, 4K HDR and AI-upscaling, and a customizable remote, then Nvidia Shield TV and Shield TV Pro are for you. It's got "
"Google Assistant built in and lets you stream from Chromecast apps. It's perfect for the techies and gamers who want more than Roku or Fire TV offer. The bad news: it's not cheap. The good news: "
"Nvidia seems to be better at privacy than those other guys."

"Apparently you can have a streaming TV service and have some privacy too! Indeed, Nvidia seems to do a pretty good job protecting users' privacy. They don't sell your data, which is good, especially"
" in the streaming TV space. They even list users’ privacy rights right at the top of their <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a>. These include things like, “You have the right to see the data we have "
"collected, take it with you, make corrections, withdraw consent for future uses, opt out of sharing, or erase your data all together at any time.” Good work Nvidia!"

"Nvidia’s mercifully short privacy policy includes instructions on how to set up and use an opt-out preference signal -- which helps users opt-out of website tracking all at once through a browser "
"extension instead of having to fiddle with cookie banners everywhere they go. Which is good, because if you do consent to receive marketing communications, Nvidia say they can gather data about you "
"from publicly available sources across the internet and <i>\"identity enrichment data from third-party sources\"</i> and share that with business partners and advertisers like Google to target you "
"with interest-based ads. That's not great...so don't forget to log into their Privacy Center to disable sharing with third party advertisers."

"Nvidia's remote only listens for your voice when you push a button on the remote. That's a nice feature. Beware though, any asks you make of Google Assistant or Alexa to play your TV shows can be "
"collected by Google and Amazon and used to target you with ads and content. While we are cautioning you, we should also mention that Nvidia reportedly suffered a data breach <a id=\"a1\">in "
"2022</a>. Seventy one thousand employee credentials (no consumer data though) were stolen and some of those ended up online. It's a good reminder that nothing is 100% secure on the internet and that"
