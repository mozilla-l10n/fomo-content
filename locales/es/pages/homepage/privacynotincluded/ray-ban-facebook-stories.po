"Well, this sounds like a potential privacy nightmare. Ray-Ban teamed up with Facebook to sell glasses with two cameras and three microphones built-in that connect to the Facebook View app and, with "
"a voice command, can record what you're seeing and hearing. Then those recordings can be share to \"Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat and more.\" Yikes!!! These "
"very creepy smart glasses come in 20 different variations of styles and colors. They also come in a range of lenses including clear, sun, transition and prescription. We're not at all sure the world"

"This is the starting point for smart glasses you put on your face that include cameras and microphones and a way to share everything to social media through the Facebook View app. It is well "

"photos and videos, and the average length of videos captured. And then there are those voice requests you can make through the smart glasses and the app. Meta describes those voice interactions as "
"“things you say when using our voice services, including when voice services are mistakenly invoked, as well as any background sound that can be heard once voice services are enabled.” So, what you "

"Beyond all of these very serious privacy concerns, there’s another, <a id=\"a1\">perhaps even bigger privacy concern</a> that must be considered. Meta/Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg seem quite "

"id=\"a3\">some privacy regulators worry</a> that isn’t enough to protect people from unknown recording. And what if you don’t want to be recorded? Or surveilled? How do you opt out of being "
"recorded? We don’t see a way and many others have the same concerns. Meta has built in some privacy protections, which, yay!, but the question is, <a id=\"a4\">are they enough</a>? The answer seems "

"As for what data is shared between Ray-Ban’s parent company Luxottica and Facebook, well, here’s what we can tell you. The Meta/Facebook privacy policy says, “Luxottica does not collect information "
"directly from your use of the Glasses and the App.” However, any information you provide directly to Luxottica is theirs. And they say the two companies can exchange personal information such as "
"name, email, Facebook account information with each other to help resolve customer service issues. Finally, Meta says, “we also exchange aggregated information and insights with Luxottica relating "
"to marketing, usage, sales, and post-sale activities.” So, yes, some of your information is shared back and forth between the companies. Which isn’t great, but still, we think all the crazy amounts "
