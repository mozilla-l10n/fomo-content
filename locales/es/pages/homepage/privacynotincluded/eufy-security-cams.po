"Eufy makes both indoor and outdoor security cameras to keep an eye on your home, your pets, and your neighborhood. They offer the standard features--HD video, live streaming, two-way audio, night "
"vision. You store your data locally on a microSD card or on Eufy's HomeBase video storage and management box. Then live stream your video to your phone in the Eufy app where they use strong end-to-"
"ed encryption to protect your video. For pet owners, the cameras use an AI that detects and sends a notification if you pet is present. These cameras even have a feature that lets you play a warning"
" message to your pooch if he goes in the living room when he's not supposed to. Humans love it. Dogs, not so much. As for privacy and security, well, Eufy could do better there."

"In 2021 your intrepid *Privacy Not Included researcher decided she needed some indoor security cams to help keep an eye on her beloved kitty while away on a trip for a couple of nights. Being a "
"privacy researcher, the one feature I demanded in my security cams was that all video be stored locally where I had control over it, not out on the internet in the less secure cloud. So I bought "
"Eufy’s security cams for their local storage and because at the time they seemed to do a pretty good job protecting my personal data. Unfortunately, taking a look back at Eufy’s (actually, their "
"parent company Anker’s) privacy policy in 2022 leaves me a bit worried about my decision."

"And this is a common problem with connected products. Companies reserved the right to update their <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> at any time. And so overnight a company’s privacy policy can go "
"from good to bad, or from OK to not-so-OK at least. That seems to be what happened with Eufy. A company I felt pretty OK with in the past now earns our *Privacy Not Included warning label. Boo!"

"Eufy says they can collect a good deal of personal information on you -- things like name, email, gender, birth date, location, device information, and more. And while Eufy says they don’t sell your"
" personal information -- which is good -- they say they can use that information to show you ads from them and third party advertisers, which isn’t so good (but also pretty standard on the internet "
"these days). They also say they can collect personal information on you from third parties who provide it to them, such as law enforcement authorities. This worries us a bit because the way that "
"line in their privacy policy is written is rather vague and seems like it could leave open the possibility they could collect information on users from a variety of third parties, for example, data "
"brokers."

"Eufy’s security cameras still do some really good privacy-related things. We really like that your security cam footage is stored locally where only you can access and control it, not in the much "
"less secure cloud (there is a cloud option though). You can access your videos at any time through the Eufy app, and that footage is protected by strong end-to-end encryption. This is all very cool."
" Eufy's AI provides human, pet, and crying detection for what your security cams see. One key value of Eufy's local storage is that all AI analysis of humans and crying babies is done locally, which"
" ensures privacy and is usually much quicker than cloud-based AI analysis. One other advantage of Eufy’s local storage of video is it <a id=\"a1\">makes it harder for law enforcement to get their "
"hands on it without your consent</a>, which is a good thing."
