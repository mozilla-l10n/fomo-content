"Amazon's other line of video doorbells, they also own Ring, is the more affordable Blink video doorbell. This camera-on-your-front-porch offers all the usual: HD video, two-way audio, motion "
"detection and night vision. The Blink video doorbell also has local storage (yay!) as well as the option for a subscription cloud storage service. It's Amazon, so of course these work with Alexa. "
"You can keep an eye on everything with the Blink Home Monitor app on your phone. As they say on their website, \"Blink and you're home,\" which, honestly, I have no idea what that means."

"Blink was acquired by Amazon in December, 2017. Amazon's other security camera maker, Ring, has had a <a id=\"a1\">plethora of privacy and security issues</a> they've had to deal with over the past "
"couple years. Blink is not Ring. Blink video doorbells don't easily work on the Ring Neighbors app that has raised concerns for us around public safety and racism. You can manually upload a Blink "
"video to the Neighbors app, but you can do that with any video. And these Blink cameras have a local storage option that means you aren’t required to store your video in the Cloud to access it, "
"which is a much better privacy option."

"Blink cameras have had a few <a id=\"a1\">reported</a> security <a id=\"a2\">vulnerabilities</a>, often found by <a id=\"a3\">security researchers</a> and fixed quickly with firmware updates, which "
"is how it should be (and a good reminder to keep your device’s firmware up-to-date!). It’s still concerning when security vulnerabilities like the ones found in Blink could allow bad guys to hijack "
"your camera. This is always a concern with any security camera though."

"Blink says they “are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others,” which is good. However, they are an Amazon company, so expect that Amazon will try and sell you "

" your house, so it's remember to not point them directly at your neighbor's bedroom. We all deserve privacy in our growing surveillance world."
