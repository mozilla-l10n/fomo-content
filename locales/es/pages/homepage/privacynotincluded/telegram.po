"Telegram became one of the most downloaded apps in the world in 2021 and now has over 500 million active users. We skipped reviewing Telegram when the pandemic hit in 2020 because it didn't offer "
"group video calls at the time. Telegram added the group video call feature in August 2020, so here we are. With features like secret chats that can self-destruct, the ability to message up to "
"200,000 people in a group (what in the group chat hell!?), and channels with one-way messaging, Telegram became a favorite for people looking to jump ship from WhatsApp when they changed their "
"privacy policy early in 2021. Unfortunately, Telegram has also has become a favorite for people sharing misinformation, hate speech, child porn, and stolen personal data. Boo! Telegram likes to bill"
" itself as one of the most private and secure chat apps out there. We're not so sure."

"There is good news and bad news when it comes to Telegram. The good news: Video calls (and voice calls) are encrypted end-to-end which makes them private and secure from start to finish. Yay! The "
"bad news: Text messages and files are not encrypted end-to-end by default. This means unless users chose to use Telegram’s “secret chat” feature which does use end-to-end encryption, this "
"information could be vulnerable to eavesdroppers. For a messaging app that says it focuses on security, it might not be as quite as secure as users hope, unless extra steps are taken. Telegram also "
"seems to have a third-party AI-bot problem. These AI-bots can do cool things like respond to messages and schedule reminders. They also can and have been abused and used for some pretty terrible "
"things. Like last year when an AI-bot created abusive deepfake naked images of women and girls. Ick! And worse, researchers claim Telegram was initially not very responsive at taking this disgusting"
" bot down. Double ick! More bad news: Telegram has had some pretty serious hacks and security flaws. In 2019, it was reported protesters in Hong Kong had their telephone numbers exposed and "
"monitored by Chinese authorities. And there was a voicemail hack that reportedly exposed some Brazilian politicians' data. In 2020, Iranian hackers reportedly were able to get past Telegram’s "
"security to spy on opponents. All in all, it seems a fair amount can and has gone wrong on Telegram. Couple that with instances of the spread of hate speech, violence, and abuse on the platform and "
"we think there are better privacy and security focused apps out there like Signal and Threema."
