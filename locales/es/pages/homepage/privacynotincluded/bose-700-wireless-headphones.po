"Bose makes some nice headphones, if you can afford them. These noise cancelling headphones also offer stellar microphones to pick up your voice on calls in your office or in the world. You can also "
"ask Alexa a question with a wake word or get Google Assistant or Siri involved too. And one tap gets you into your favorite Spotify playlist. All this through a Bluetooth connection to your phone. "
"Fancy, pricey, and hopefully not too likely to invade your privacy (although Amazon and Spotify will collect data on those requests you make or songs you play)."

"So, what's going on with Bose's privacy? Well, they can be rather nosey, for a smart speaker/headphone company. They collect a fair amount of personal information, such as your name, email, address,"
" location from IP address and sometimes your precise location too, if you allow them. This is all pretty normal. They also say they can collect information about you from third parties, \"such as "
"business partners, marketers, researchers, analysts, social network services, and other parties to help us supplement our records.\" And then there is all the data Bose says they can collect about "
"you automatically through the use of the smart speakers, headphones, apps, websites, and even in their retail stores. So yeah, Bose hopes to build a pretty good profile on you, which , ugh, why does"
" a headphone company need to build such a profile on you?"

"To market you stuff, that's why. Bose says they do share or \"sell\" (under the <a id=\"a1\">definition of sell</a> in California's strong <a id=\"a2\">CCPA privacy law</a>) some personal "
"information to third party advertising partners to target you with ads. This generally includes your email address as well as the information Bose says they can collect on you automatically through "
"their technologies. That means the use and interaction with their website, apps, devices, and interactions in their retails stores. That includes things like your location, IP address, what media "
"you access, what content you listen to such as <i>\"sleep tracks, stations, playlists, artists, albums, songs, or podcasts,\"</i> and even sensor data from your headphones such as your head "
"orientation and movement, and environmental data such as the noise levels and audio frequencies of sounds around you. That seems like a lot of weird little data points to collect about you. And "
"while this might not reach the crazy level of what a car or your phone can collect and share on you, well, dang people, it's your smart speaker and headphones!. Headphones and smart speakers "
"collecting and then sharing things like your head movement, environmental data like the sounds around you, and what podcats you like to listen to and where you are just seems kinda creepy."

"Bose goes on to say they may use or share de-identified personal data for any purpose they choose, <a id=\"a1\">without limitation</a>. This actually worries us a good bit because privacy "

"a company say they can share anonymous data without limitation, that's generally not as worrisome as that is data that is no longer personal information. But de-identified data could still be "
"personal information, so for Bose to claim they can use your de-identified data \"without limitation,\" that is something that worries us."
