"Apple had a recent serious security vulnerability. From <a id=\"a1\">Firewall Times</a>: \"In September 2021, researchers discovered that a spyware called Pegasus had infected iPhones and other "
"Apple Devices via a ‘zero click exploit’, granting the spyware broad power over a users’ device. Once infected, the spyware could record calls and messages and even turn the device camera and "
"microphone on without the user knowing. Pegasus was produced by the NSO Group, an Israel-based company that sells its spyware to governments such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Though this spyware "
"would presumably be used to surveil terrorists and criminal enterprises, these governments have also used it to spy on activists, politicians, and journalists. As of September 13, 2021, Apple has "
