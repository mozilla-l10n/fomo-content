"OkCupid, the only dating app that matches you on what matters to you -- or so they say -- turns 20 years old (yes, you're old too). To sign up, you fill out a personality test and give your personal"
" information. Based on that personality quiz, OkCupid's algorithm shows you a measurement of compatibility with potential matches. It's basically a percentage score that represents how likely "
"OkCupid's algorithm thinks you are to click with someone. With no real transparency into their algorithm, who knows how accurate their compatibility measurement is. Good news though, you can "
"increase the odds by paying extra for premium features or to \"SuperBoost\" your profile and have it shown to more users for three, six, or twelve hours. As their slogan says, \"Dating deserves "
"better.\" Guess what, we think your privacy on OkCupid deserves better too."

"OkCupid’s privacy and security is… not OK. In 2020, the app came under fire for possible <a id=\"a1\">GDPR violations</a> for what a Norwegian consumer group called “out of control” <a "

"So OkCupid and their parent company Match Group have not been known for their security or transparency. You’d think a dating app that’s open about their <a id=\"a1\">love for data</a> would be "
"better at keeping it safe. Indeed, OkCupid’s mysterious matching algorithm involves crunching the numbers on your answers to 15 to <a id=\"a2\">500</a> personality-quiz-style questions -- some of "
"which are <a id=\"a3\">written by ChatGPT</a>. That means they can publish some really interesting <a id=\"a4\">findings</a> about the state of <a id=\"a5\">digital dating</a>. Nice, cool. But it "
"also means its users are volunteer research subjects who end up giving away a ton of super intimate information -- <a id=\"a6\">about</a> sex, pizza toppings, politics, and whether they believe the "
"sun is bigger than the earth -- to improve their chances of finding someone special. Answering more questions and frequently updating your profile will lead to more matches, <a id=\"a7\">OkCupid "
"says</a>. Other things they suggest to get more matches, aside from providing more data? On their<a id=\"a8\"> guide to their working their algorithm</a>, OKCupid seems to suggest connecting your "
"Instagram to your OKCupid account will help you get more matches. That tip gets a thumbs down for us. You should know that when you connect your social media to dating apps, both platforms can "
