"HER is a dating app targeted at lesbian, bisexual, and queer people. Launched in 2013 and then rebranded in 2015 as HER, this dating app claims to have over 13 million \"sapphic folks\" as users. "
"Cool! The app works with the swipe left/swipe right dating app format and is free to sign up. Users who choose not to upgrade to premium can get access to most of the app's features with some "
"limits. That means viewing profiles, swiping, chatting, and getting access to community groups and events. HER Premium Gold unlocks an ad-free experience, more search filters, incognito mode, and "
"more. Users who splash out on a Platinum subscription get unlimited swipes, read receipts and a free <a id=\"a1\">Thirst Mode</a> credit every month! So, how is Her at privacy and security? Well, "
"not too bad, but not perfect either."

"If we were grading on a bell curve, we'd consider Her to be pretty good at privacy -- reading through Her's privacy policy isn't too bad. But since we're not grading on a curve, we have to warn that"
" this app for the sapphic folks out there might come with *Privacy Not Included. That's because we couldn't confirm whether Her meets our Minimum Security Standards. We're not sure if the app uses "
"encryption and whether the company has a way to manage security vulnerabilities. That's a concern! So even though Her's privacy policy isn't as bad as many other dating apps we reviewed, we just "

"include in your dating profile. Her's <a id=\"a1\">privacy policy</a> does say you can use an alias if you like and that providing personal information is optional. That's cool! Hopefully that's "

" to this app -- or any app, really -- using social media, like with your Instagram account. If you do, both apps can potentially exchange information about you. And the last thing you need is for "
