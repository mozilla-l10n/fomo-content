"Mozilla’s work on AI is not new – we’ve been funding, building and advocating for trustworthy AI approaches for years. In 2020, we published a <a id=\"a1\">white paper</a> that outlined our vision "
"for trustworthy AI in a nascent moment for the technology. Since then, a lot has changed. Today, AI is increasingly powerful and pervasive in our society, and its promise and perils are becoming "
"even more apparent. While there are a growing number of individuals and organizations working on making AI more trustworthy, the scope of the challenge is also continuing to grow. And while we’ve "
