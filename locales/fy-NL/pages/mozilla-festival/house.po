"As a global social media company, TikTok must operate within and adapt to different cultures and geopolitics, even when presenting as a neutral or apolitical platform. At AI Forensics (formerly "
"Tracking Exposed), we develop tools and conduct research on how TikTok contorts itself in these different contexts, whether it be censoring LGBTQ+ terms in countries where sexuality is contested or "
"limiting access to international content during times of war, which the company quietly did for Russian TikTok users when tweaking their policies in response to Russia’s Fake News law."

"This workshop will present free tools, cross-national methodologies, and the recent research investigating TikTok to make opaque platform decisions more transparent and hold them accountable. It "
"will primarily explain how to use our most recent TikTok tool for researchers and journalists: TKGlobalObservatory, now in the beta stage. The tool allows one to compare TikTok’s algorithmic feed "
"recommendations (For You Page) across almost 200 countries for non-logged-in users, thanks to the access to a database covering nearly ten months with around 1milion pieces of evidence collected. We"
" are developing this software to understand how TikTok sees the world and maps new digital boundaries and proximities through its recommendation system. We will learn to look for emerging patterns, "
"trends, and concerns between and within geographically dispersed countries. Participants will have a chance to brainstorm and share ideas on the research that this tool enables; they will have "
"access to the tool in the beta stage to run some exploitative analysis and see examples of the software in action. Ideally, they will come away from this session with research ideas and "
"methodological possibilities to be explored later. We will also discuss the limitations of such research and how the research community can adapt to and move beyond such barriers."
