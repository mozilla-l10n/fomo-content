"Common Voice is the most diverse open voice dataset in the world. Most voice datasets are owned by companies, which stifles innovation. They also under-represent almost every language in the world, "
"as well as people of colour, disabled people, women and LGBTQIA+ people. We want to change that by mobilising people everywhere to share their voice."

"Great question. Community is the amazing web of artists, engineers, activists, data scientists, organisers and researchers who contribute their time to make Common Voice possible. Some of our "
"community are deeply networked - they spend time together, both online and in person - others prefer to watch closely and contribute regularly without chatting that much. We welcome everyone!"

"Every community member is different - some contribute code to make the platform better, others build things with the dataset and others build partnerships to open source text sentences. People who "
"have been in the community for a while might help new languages to on-board by answering questions in our forums, or talk at events to spread the word! It takes a lot of work to make our dream of "
"safe, inclusive language technology for everyone a reality. If you have a skill or an idea and you’re not sure how to apply it - just reach out to our community team!"
