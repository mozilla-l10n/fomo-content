"<b>What is a delta release?</b> Let’s imagine you had downloaded Common Voice 10 for Catalan, a total download size of 49 GB, now Common Voice 11 is released and you want to get all that amazing new"

"<b>Wat is in delta-release?</b> Stel jo foar dat jo Common Voice 10 foar Katalaansk downloaden hawwe, in totale downloadgrutte fan 49 GB, no is Common Voice 11 frijlitten en jo wolle al dy geweldige"

"<b>Why are you doing this?</b> We have had a lot of feedback from the community that the large download sizes were a problem for many users and developers wanting to use the dataset. The download "
"size can take a long time for people on slow connections and downloading a large amount of data can be difficult on unstable connections too. For many of our community, being forced to download "
"clips that they already have from the previous release has been costly and wasteful."
msgstr ""
"<b>Wêrom dogge jimme dit?</b> Wy hawwe in protte feedback krigen fan de mienskip dat de downloadgrutte in probleem wie foar in protte brûkers en ûntwikkelers dy’t de gegevensset brûke wolle. De "
"downloadgrutte kin lang duorje foar minsken op trage ferbiningen en it downloaden fan in grutte hoemannichte gegevens kin ek lestich wêze op ynstabile ferbiningen. Foar in protte fan ús mienskip is "
"twongen om klips te downloaden dy’t se al hawwe fan de foarige release kostber en fergriemend west."
